I read [this story](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/) recently. It ticked all the boxes: sci-fi speculation on the nature of reality, delivering an interesting point in a handful of pages, by a writer I'm already something of a fan of. And yet there was something deeply unsatisfying about it.

Mostly, I think, it's the treatment of the characters. Most seem to stand around waiting meekly for their turn to speak, and it's impossible to imagine e.g. Haruhi doing this. A story with this many characters is already borderline unworkable, but this many *main* characters is simply impossible. A main character needs to have an active personality (Haruhi) or at least a talkative one (Kyon); David Eddings wrote Belgarath as stupid (though powerful) quite deliberately so that it would make sense for other characters to explain things to him.
