As always, Best Girl says what she must, and gets nothing but hatred for it.

I mentioned this project to a friend over the new year, and his response was "how are you handling all the stock footage?" And whether it's a genuine change, or just a function of paying more attention, this episode seemed to contain a lot of previous footage: Milly's outburst from the previous episode, Tolle's death, Kira's flashbacks to previous fights. While a certain amount of reflection is in order after the last big fight, two episodes is pushing it, particularly with so little in the way of resolution: we're no wiser about how Kira was mysteriously spirited away to ZAFT territory, and the ZAFT political discussion between people we care nothing about is made all the more irrelevant by concluding that they should continue as planned.
