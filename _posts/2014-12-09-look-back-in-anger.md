I've read of two departures from the animé scene in the last couple of weeks: TheFluff's very public cutting of ties with the community, and a friend's much quieter decision to give it up. I'm a long way from following them - only yesterday I visited some old friends to watch a show, and my own weekly animé nights go from strength to strength - but it's as good a reason as any for a moment's reflection.

I got into animé relatively late; I'd watched a handful of movies in high school (borrowing DVDs from my local library - my family never had Sky), but it wasn't until university that I really started to acquire and watch animé the way we now recognize it - which means in 2015 it'll be 10 years since I started. So I've decided to rewatch (the HD remake of) my first "proper" animé series: *Mobile Suit Gundam SEED*.

*Seed* is a show I retain a lot of fondness for, partly because I won't be troubled by comparisons to other Gundams (I dropped *00* early on, and aside from a couple of OVAs, never really tried any others).
