The silent run - and corresponding countermeasures - has a glorious space opera history. It formed one of the central scenes in the glorious *Starship Operators*, still one of my all-time favourite shows. More recently, a frankly laughable example was one of many things that kept *Space Battleship Yamato 2199* from being something my group could take seriously.

*Gundam Seed* is somewhere in between. A few of the details are right - deceleration with the main engines, spaceships that can rotate on a pinhead but struggle to change their linear velocity. A couple of hours is a plausible timeframe for an orbital rendezvous, at least if we assume we're well above LEO - maybe space colonies would be in geosynchronous orbit? It's hard to imagine the moon playing a meaningful role in earth-orbital combat, except by long-range kinetic attacks - something which doesn't seem to exist in the *Gundam* universe (and would probably have wiped out *everything* in orbit). And there seems to be some inconsistency about gravity - people float around when it suits the visuals, but adopt conventional up-down postures more often than not, and I'm pretty sure the queue of civilians being interviewed was lining up on the floor. Still, acceptable space opera breaks from reality.

More interesting is 

I noticed the EVA-style flashing text in the opening - just a couple of frames each. First time before EVA etc.

The public discussion about Artemis is interesting. For all Badriguel's militarity, etc.
