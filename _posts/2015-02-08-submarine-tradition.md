The silent run - and corresponding countermeasures - has a glorious space opera history. It formed one of the central scenes in the glorious *Starship Operators*, still one of my all-time favourite shows. More recently, a frankly laughable example was one of many things that kept *Space Battleship Yamato 2199* from being something my group could take seriously.

*Gundam Seed* is somewhere in between. A few of the details are right - deceleration with the main engines, spaceships rotating widly 

I noticed the EVA-style flashing text in the opening - just a couple of frames each. First time before EVA etc.

The public discussion about Artemis is interesting. For all Badriguel's militarity, etc.
