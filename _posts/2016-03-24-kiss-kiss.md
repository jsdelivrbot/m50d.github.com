Episode "14" was a recap episode - and 15 feels like more of the same. The 4-minute infodump reads like a recap of a series that never existed, the glorious adventures of Clifford growing up - something that could honestly make for an interesting prequel. But the delivery mechanism is poor; too much telling, not enough showing. Rather than calling back to this monologue later in the episode, as Kira lies hospitalized, it would have been better to explain these things through such incidents.

It's the same problem as with the military power struggles - the skeleton of a wider world, which is something I'm usually in favour of, but somehow I find myself caring. Partly just the main conflict seems underdeveloped: ZAFT and the Earth forces feel too black-and-white, 

Especially given that the alien artifact - and the rest of the backstory - are, as far as I recall, a complete irrelevance to the rest of the story
