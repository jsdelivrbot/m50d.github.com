In case anyone's wondering where 14 went, it was a recap episode - and for the start of this one you'd be forgiven for thinking the same thing. The 4-minute infodump reads like a recap of a series that never existed, the glorious adventures of Clifford growing up - something that could honestly make for an interesting prequel. But the delivery mechanism is poor; too much telling, not enough showing. Rather than calling back to this monologue later in the episode, as Kira lies hospitalized, it would have been better to explain these things through such incidents.
Especially given that the alien artifact - and the rest of the backstory - are, as far as I recall, a complete irrelevance to the rest of the story. It's the same problem as with the military power struggles - the skeleton of a wider world, which is something I'm usually in favour of, but it's hard to care in this case. Partly just the main conflict seems underdeveloped.
