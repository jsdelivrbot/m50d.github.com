Episode "14" was a recap episode - and 15 feels like more of the same. The 4-minute infodump reads like a recap of a series that never existed, the glorious adventures of Clifford growing up - something that could honestly make for an interesting prequel. But the delivery mechanism is poor; too much telling, not enough showing. Rather than calling back to this monologue later in the episode, as Kira lies hospitalized, it would have been better to explain these things through such incidents.

It's the same problem as with the Earth military power struggles - normally I love setting details, but somehow this time I find myself not caring. Partly just the main conflict seems underdeveloped: *Gundam Seed* is clearly trying to show that war is stupid, but it does it too well: the internal disagreement among the Earth forces was motivated by nothing more than petty jealousy; similarly Le Creuset seems to simply want war. Interesting conflicts happen between 

Especially given that the alien artifact - and the rest of the backstory - are, as far as I recall, a complete irrelevance to the rest of the story
