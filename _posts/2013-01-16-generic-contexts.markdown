I took a [Category Theory course](http://gopher.srcf.net:70/users/md401/pt3notes/category.pdf) at university, but in truth I never understood more than the basics. [Lampson's (or Wheeler's) Law](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ButlerLampson) applies just as strongly in mathematics, and I hit my personal indirection limit about a third of the way through.

Fortunately, in software we know how to avoid this: Agile. We don't implement theories or patterns; we solve problems, and abstract away as much as we can.
