I took a [Category Theory course](http://gopher.srcf.net:70/users/md401/pt3notes/category.pdf) at university, but in truth I never understood more than the basics. [Lampson's (or Wheeler's) Law](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ButlerLampson) applies just as strongly in mathematics, and I hit my personal indirection limit about a third of the way through.

Fortunately, in software we know how to avoid this: Agile. So let's talk through (an anonymized version of) a real-life problem I had at work, and the abstraction that can be used to solve it - no theory, just programming.

##Level 1: Flatmap that Shit

Suppose we have a series of functions that might fail - perhaps they're calls to remote webservices that could go down.

    val f1: {} => Option[Int] = ...;
    val f2: Int => Option[String] = ...;
    val f3: String => Option[Set[Int]] = ...;

We want to call them one after another, and return a failure if any of them fails, success if they're all succesful. The most naÃ¯ve possible way to write our function looks something like:
    
    def doFunctionsInSequence1(): Option[Set[Int]] = {
      val r1 = f1(null)
      if(!r1.isEmpty) {
        val r2 = f2(r1.get)
        if(!r2.isEmpty)
          f3(r2.get)
        else None
        }
      else None
    }
    
Even typing this makes me feel ill - and replacing the ifs and gets with cases and pattern-matching, while more idiomatic, would be no better. There are too many branches in this code (as would show up under measures like NPath or Cyclomatic complexity) when fundamentally it's just running through a flat sequence of functions:

    def doFunctionsInSequence2(): Option[Set[Int]] =
      f1(null) flatMap f2 flatMap f3

##Level 2: "for", not just for collections any more

Flatmap is great when each step is an existing function - but when each stage is a handful of statements that don't make sense as a function in their own right, we can easily end-up in callback hell with the so-called [pyramid of doom](http://raynos.github.com/presentation/shower/controlflow.htm?full#PyramidOfDoom)

    def doFunctionsInSequence3(): Option[Set[Int]] = {
      f1(null) flatMap {i: Int => f2(i + 3) flatMap {
        s:String => 
          val t = s.toUpperCase + i
          f3(t + s)
        }
      }
    }

This can get especially bad when using futures, as the point at which we want to perform an asynchronous step is often not a clean break in the logic of the code. Say we're using futures to make asynchronous calls to some web API (so that a small number of pooled threads can make our calls to lots of slow third-party web servers in parallel, rather than having to keep one blocked thread around for each call that hasn't completed yet).

    def webApi1(s: String): Future[Int] = ...
    def webApi2(i: Int): Future(Set[Int]) = ...
    def webApi3(i: Int): Future[String] = ...
    
    def fetchSomeData(username: String): Future[Set[Int]] =
      webApi1("hello") flatMap {
        userId: Int =>
          val alternateFormatId = reformat(userId)
          logSomething()
          webApi3(alternateFormatId) flatMap {
            api3Output: String =>
              val objectRepresentation = parseJson(api3Ouptut)
              val keyForApi2 = if(objectRepresentation.someFlag) objectRepresentation.field1(alternateFormatId)
                else objectRepresentation.wrapper2(userId).field1
              val ret = webApi2(keyForApi2)
              logSomethingElse()
              ret
            }
        }

I've seen worse code in my time, but this is pretty nasty. We can make it clearer using scala's for/yield syntax (misleadingly called [sequence comprehensions](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/111) in the official tour, but useful for far more than sequences).

    def fetchSomeData(username: String): Future[Set[Int]] =
      for {
        userId <- webApi1("hello")
        alternateFormatId = reformat(userId)
        _ = logSomething()
        api3Output <- webApi3(alternateFormatId)
        objectRepresentation = parseJson(api3Ouptut)
        keyForApi2 = if(objectRepresentation.someFlag) objectRepresentation.field1(alternateFormatId)
           else objectRepresentation.wrapper2(userId).field1
        ret <- webApi2(keyForApi2)
        _ = logSomethingElse()
      } yield(ret)

Still not the nicest function in the world, but it's a definite improvement.

##Level 3: Let's traverse a collection

I left the Set\[Int\] 'til last in the previous example, because using it presents a problem. Often we want to fetch a set (or list, or map... but let's not get ahead of ourselves) from one web service, and then call another service for each element - imagine a twitter-like service where we fetch all the tweets for a given user by calling one service to get their IDs, and then call another service with each ID to fetch the tweets themselves. So we want to write something like this:

    def mysteryFunction[T](futureSet: Set[Future[T]]): Future[Set[T]] = ...
    
    def fetchTweets(username: String): Future[(UserProfile, Set[TweetData])] =
      for {
        userId <- getUserId(username)
        tweetIds <- getTweetIds(userId)
        tweetDataFutureSet = for { //We can still use for on sequences
          tweetId <- tweetIds
          tweetData <- getTweetData(tweetId)
        } yield(tweetData)
        tweetDataSet <- mysteryFunction(tweetDataFutureSet)
        userProfile <- getUserProfile(userId)
      } yield((UserProfile, tweetData))
      
mysteryFunction is some kind of "gather" function; it takes a Set of Futures (results that will be available at some point in the future), and returns a Future for the set of all the results (so this Set will be available at some point in the future - namely, when all the individual results are). Without mysteryFunction, this code won't compile; tweetDataFutures is a Set\[Future\[TweetData\]\] where we need a single Future; we can't just write "tweetDataSet <- tweetDataFutureSet" (that would make tweetDataSet a Future, when we want it to be a Set).

Thinking about it, we can easily see how to combine a Future\[Set\[T]]\] and a Future\[T\] to add the T to the set:

    def addToFutureSet[T](futureSet: Future[Set[T]], futureElementToAdd: Future[T])
        (implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Set[T]] =
      for {
        set <- futureSet
        elementToAdd <- futureElementToAdd
      } yield(set + elementToAdd)

If we were imperative-minded we might implement mysteryFunction like this:

    def mysteryFunction[T](futureSet: Set[Future[T]])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Set[T]] = {
      var workingSetFuture: Future[Set[T]] = future(Set())
      for {future <- futureSet} {workingSetFuture = addToFutureSet(workingSetFuture, future)}
      workingSetFuture
    }

But hopefully we can recognize this as a fold:

    def mysteryFunction[T](futureSet: Set[Future[T]])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Set[T]] =
      futureSet.foldLeft(future(Set[T]()))(addToFutureSet)

As you may have guessed, our mysteryFunction is generally known as "traverse" (or rather, this is the special case "sequence").

When working with several APIs of this form, we might find ourselves wanting to do the same thing with List instead of Set - and perhaps other containers as well. It turns out it's quite easy to rewrite our method to work for most scala containers, though the type signature is a bit intimidating:

    def traverse[TL[X] <: TraversableLike[X, TL[X]] with GenTraversable[X]
        with GenericTraversableTemplate[X, TL], T]
        (futureTraversableLike: TL[Future[T]])
        (implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[TL[T]] = {
      def addToFutureTL[T](futureTL: Future[TL[T]], futureElementToAdd: Future[T]): Future[TL[T]] =
        for {
          tl <- futureTL
          elementToAdd <- futureElementToAdd
        } yield {
          val builder = tl.genericBuilder[T]
          builder ++= tl
          builder += elementToAdd
          builder.result
        }
      futureTraversableLike.foldLeft(future{})(addToFutureTL)
    }
