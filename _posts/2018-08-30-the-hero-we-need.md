title: The Hero We Need (Gundam Seed 35)
---
This is La Flaga's episode - and Ramius' as well. Weeks of expectation and buildup finally resolve themselves into a full fleet engagement, which is (rightly) where the "adults" of the show shine. We have a running theme of stepping up and taking responsibility where no-one else can; La Flaga's "I didn't choose to become a hero" protests a little too much, but matches up with his actions.
