title: The Hero We Need (Gundam Seed 35)
---
This is La Flaga's episode - and Ramius' as well. Weeks of expectation and buildup finally resolve themselves into a full fleet engagement, which is (rightly) where the "adults" of the show shine. We have a running theme of stepping up and taking responsibility where no-one else can; La Flaga's "I didn't choose to become a hero" protests a little too much, but matches up with his actions. More subtly, Ramius first leads the Archangel forward to cover a gap in the line, and then takes clear personal responsibility for ordering the retreat at the peak of the episode. What's particularly interesting here is that Milly's fatalistic suggestion is born of the same impulse: in directly contradicting her, Ramius makes the case for a more flexible and personal sense of duty and also, indirectly, for the wisdom of experience.
