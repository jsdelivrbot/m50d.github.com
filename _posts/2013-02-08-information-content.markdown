I've joked that I rank people by Kolmogorov complexity. Someone who teaches me new things and challenges me in conversation makes a better (or at least more interesting) friend than someone whose every word I can easily predict. But of course, if my statement were literally true, a friend who constantly spewed incomprehensible gibberish would be better than either.

And yet, I could write a program to generate incomprehensible gibberish in a couple of lines of perl (we'd just have to be careful not to mix up the program and its output). A person talking gibberish would probably be doing *less thinking* than someone who was making careful, well-reasoned responses to what I said - even if the latter is more predictable in some narrow sense.
