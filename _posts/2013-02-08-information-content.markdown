I've joked that I rank people by Kolmogorov complexity. Someone who teaches me new things and challenges me in conversation makes a better (or at least more interesting) friend than someone whose every word I can easily predict. But of course, if my statement were literally true, a friend who constantly spewed incomprehensible gibberish would be better than either.

And yet, I could write a program to generate incomprehensible gibberish in a couple of lines of perl (we'd just have to be careful not to mix up the program and its output). A person talking gibberish would probably be doing *less thinking* than someone who was making careful, well-reasoned responses to what I said - even if the latter is more predictable in some narrow sense.

Cultural context has a similar effect. Someone writing German will convey more information to me than someone writing nonsense, and someone writing English more still. But an alien writing English can tell me far less than someone with whom I'm embedded in a common culture. When, in *The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya*, Koizumi tells us his class "ended up doing [the Tom Stoppard version](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RosencrantzAndGuildensternAreDead)", we learn far more than seven words have any right to convey; that he's easygoing and literate, but also that he appreciates the absurdity of his position as a fictional character.
