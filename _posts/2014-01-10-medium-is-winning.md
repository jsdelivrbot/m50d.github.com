For years I've been asking for a recommendation system for internet content. I've been an enthusiastic user[1] of [last.fm](http://last.fm) for almost a decade, and have spent many an hour pruning my [Amazon](http://amazon.co.uk) recommendations, even before I switched to Kindle[2]. The loss of [AniDB](http://anidb.net)'s "Anime Hint" feature has massively reduced my consumption of old shows (I now rely on word-of-mouth-like recommendations, which mostly means current series), and I never really found a good service for movies (though I've since heard good things about Netflix) - so I stopped watching movies.

So it's ironic that, despite all these established old-media recommendation engines, there was nothing for one of my favourite media - online articles.
