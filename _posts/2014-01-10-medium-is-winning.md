For years I've been asking for a recommendation system for internet content. I've been an enthusiastic user[1] of last.fm for almost a decade, and have spent many an hour pruning my Amazon recommendations, even before I switched to Kindle[2]. The loss of AniDB's "Anime Hint" feature has massively reduced my consumption of old shows (I now rely on word-of-mouth-like recommendations, which mostly means current series), and I never really found a good service for movies (though I've since heard good things about Netflix) - so I stopped watching movies.

So it's ironic that, despite all these established old-media recommendation engines, there was nothing for one of my favourite media - online articles. Oh, sure, there are plenty of blog-cum-social-networks - Livejournal was a social network before the term existed, and you're notified when your friends post new content. I imagine Wordpress offers something similar. Tumblr started out this way, and while most tumblrs are full of pictures, if you follow the right people you can get these kind of articles. Both Google+ users post long-form articles there. I've even got one friend blogging with Facebook's new "Notes" feature. But all this is more like following an existing artist or author; even the "discovery" features of these networks try to pair you up with "people you may know" - friends of friends - rather than people who write things you want to read.

Feedly - which I do use - or email subscriptions have the same problem and another: I feel obliged to read. The accusatory "2 articles unread" notification taunts me until I've caught up; even when I'd rather be doing something else I find myself unable to resist. So I refrain from adding too many feeds or using its recommendation feature, for fear I'll spend hours each morning catching up on every last post.

Aggregators like HN or Reddit fill some of the gap; I can visit one and have some confidence that most stories will be good.
