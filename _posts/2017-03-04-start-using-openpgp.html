title: It's Time to Start Using OpenPGP
---
At long last, the world is taking an interest in serious, widespread deployment of effective cryptography. As [browsers start marking HTTP as insecure](https://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2017/01/firefox-chrome-start-calling-http-connections-insecure/) and messaging apps advertise end-to-end encryption, the dream of the cypherpunks might seem to finally be reaching fruition, a decade or two behind schedule.

Yet we're also seeing a turning away from things vital to true privacy and security. Open-source code, pseudonymity and decentralisation were long seen as table stakes for serious security systems, yet a number of "modern" cryptosystems discard all of those. Flaws in a cryptosystem used to be universally regarded as always fatal, yet when [a significant weakness in WhatsApp's handling of key changes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages) was found, prominent security researchers rushed to defend this "design decision". Most troubling of all, many prominent figures are recommending abandoning the one cryptosystem that has proven effective against even nation-state attackers, proposing replacements that offer ["almost"](http://wiki.c2.com/?AlmostConsideredHarmful) the same security properties, along with various supposed improvements.

The current crop of transport encrypted and pseudo-end-to-end encrypted messaging systems offer ample protection for the vast majority of humans using them (those who are not targeted by a nation-state level attacker). And the usability issues with current OpenPGP implementations are real and serious. But for the few who need a greater level of protection than transport encryption can offer, OpenPGP is the only cryptosystem to offer a significant step up in trustworthiness - and its issues are entirely surmountable. Those of us whose values -  are threatened by nation-state control of communication
