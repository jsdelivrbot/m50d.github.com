title: It's Time to Start Using OpenPGP
---
At long last, the world is taking an interest in serious, widespread deployment of effective cryptography. As [browsers start marking HTTP as insecure](https://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2017/01/firefox-chrome-start-calling-http-connections-insecure/) and messaging apps advertise end-to-end encryption, the dream of the cypherpunks might seem to finally be reaching fruition, a decade or two behind schedule.

Yet we're also seeing a turning away from things vital to true privacy and security. Open-source code, pseudonymity and decentralisation were long seen as table stakes for serious security systems, yet a number of "modern" cryptosystems discard all of those. Flaws in a cryptosystem used to be universally regarded as always fatal, yet when [a significant weakness in WhatsApp's handling of key changes](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages) was found, prominent security researchers rushed to defend this "design decision". Most troubling of all, many prominent figures are recommending abandoning the one cryptosystem that has proven effective against even nation-state attackers, proposing replacements that offer ["almost"](http://wiki.c2.com/?AlmostConsideredHarmful) the same security properties, along with various supposed improvements.

The current crop of transport encrypted and pseudo-end-to-end encrypted messaging systems offer ample protection for the vast majority of humans using them (those who are not targeted by a nation-state level attacker). And the usability issues with current OpenPGP implementations are real and serious. But for the few who need a greater level of protection than transport encryption can offer, OpenPGP is the only cryptosystem to offer a significant step up in trustworthiness - and its issues would be entirely surmountable with even a modest commitment of resources (that is, money). Those of us whose values - free speech, open debate, government accountability - are threatened by nation-state control of communications should be focusing our efforts there.

Security-interested folk have a healthy tendency towards absolutism; since cryptography is a rare case where 

## Models and Threats

Let's talk about what kind of attackers could be looking to compromise people's privacy and security. There are two axes here: what resources an attacker can bring to bear, and what proportion of those they're willing to focus on you personally. So most discussions of security start with something like:

 1. A private individual
   1. Targeting a broad group, e.g. a troll who dislikes your favourite videogame
   1. Targeting you specifically or a small group. e.g. a stalker/ex.
 1. A small group/organization (e.g. a company or criminal gang)
   1. E.g. a credit card fraud / identity theft gang
   1. E.g. your own employer
 1. A nation state or multinational corporation
   1. E.g. you're part of a religious minority
   1. E.g. you're part of an armed movement to overthrow your government

This is a reasonable start, but it's worth getting more specific in terms of the technologies available. Many security folks already talk about the concept of a "tier 1" state, but even this is being overly general. In reality the "intelligence community" cooperates with each other, and a threat to one state - at least one Western state - is a threat to all, and unlikely to receive any sympathy from the large multinational corporations either.

Below that, we have the CA system, the root of trust for HTTPS and most similar technologies.
