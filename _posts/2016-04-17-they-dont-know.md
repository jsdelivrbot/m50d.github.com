Treated as a giant robot show, this would be an awkward bridging episode: connecting up the plot is a necessity, but a whole week without action is a bit much. I don't remember watching these episodes clearly (it was ten years ago now), but I remember having that kind of impression about this whole arc: too slow, too inconclusive.

As the romance fan I've now become, that's less of an issue. The progressive tension between Sai, Flay and the others is handled wonderfully: what unfolds is tragedy in the classical sense, with disaster proceeding inevitably from the interaction of each character's flaws, individually insignificant. Sai's pride is excessive, but only slightly; Flay's single-minded focus would be counted an asset in another series (or, one suspects, another sex). Kira's problems seem shallow in the context of a war, but ultimately he's a teenager forced into a war he didn't want, against his own people, and isolated even from the friends he's protecting. And if he's possessive about Flay, well, she seems to appreciate his protection. If anything Kira shows a lot of maturity in the final (ish) scene (and the screenshot for this post) - but I fear that will only serve to isolate him further.
