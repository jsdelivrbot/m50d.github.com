title: "They Don't Know About Us (Gundam Seed 17)"

Treated as a giant robot show, this would be an awkward bridging episode: connecting up the plot is a necessity, but a whole week without action is a bit much. I don't remember watching these episodes clearly (it was ten years ago now), but I remember having that kind of impression about this whole arc: too slow, too inconclusive.

As the romance fan I've now become, that's less of an issue. The progressive tension with Sai, Flay and the others is handled wonderfully: what unfolds is tragedy in the classical sense, with disaster proceeding inevitably from the interaction of each character's flaws.
