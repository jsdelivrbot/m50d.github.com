Action! And not before time. There are many strands to *Gundam*, but the most fundamental is very simple: giant robot fights are cool. And while this iteration is not the hardest of sci-fi, the 3D tactics shown are at least somewhat plausible, adding up to some quite satisfying fight choreography (though admittedly we're already seeing an overpowered beam weapon).

But where the teenage drama and philosophising can stretch effortlessly to 50 episodes, the fighting side immediately runs into problems: to make fights meaningful, losing must have consequences - if defeated enemies simply return next week, we're reduced to the silliness of e.g. *Pretty Cure*. TODO To give an extreme example, in e.g. *Noir* the protagonists kill dozens of opponents each episode - but this necessarily reduces those enemies to faceless mooks.

Nikolai totally gay for Athrun - calling his name all the time.
