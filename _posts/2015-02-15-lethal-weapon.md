Action! And not before time. There are many strands to *Gundam*, but the most fundamental is very simple: giant robot fights are cool. While 

But where the teenage drama and philosophising can stretch effortlessly to 50 episodes, the fighting side immediately runs into problems: to make fights meaningful, losing must have consequences - if defeated enemies simply return next week, we're reduced to the silliness of e.g. *Pretty Cure*. TODO To give an extreme example, in e.g. *Noir* the protagonists kill dozens of opponents each episode - but this necessarily reduces those enemies to faceless mooks.

Nikolai totally gay for Athrun - calling his name all the time.
