title: Magic and Progress (Chūnibyō Demo Koi ga Shitai!)
---

I finished *Chūnibyō* over Christmas, and I hope I won't offend too many people by saying it felt particularly relevant as an ex-LARPer. I've also just finished reading Grant Morrison's *Supergods*, and it could have been written about this series - or even by one of the *Chūnibyō* characters.

Humanity is the storytelling ape; distinguished from our relatives more than anything else by our ability to connect events into narratives - or form new ones out of whole cloth. But if Morrison is to be believed, even our earliest art betrays a tension between story and reality. Cave paintings were part history, part fantasy, and part ritual - an attempt to control our reality by depicting that which we want to happen.

*Chūnibyō* swerves back and forth on whether fantasy is a good thing. At first, female lead Rikka seems to have it all worked out; she enjoys her harmless games, as do those around her; it's the stodgy normals Yuuta (male lead) and Shinka who have a problem. If they could only overcome their foolish embarassment, they too could gain magical powers and save the world.
