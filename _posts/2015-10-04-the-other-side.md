title: The Other Side (Gundam Seed 11)
---

And then after saying how much I was looking forward to the next, I go (almost) three months without reviewing an episode. Life, and specifically work, have intervened, but with luck I should now be back on track.

In many ways this episode is the mirror of the previous one: combat instead of friendship, formalities instead of individual action. And, most of all, Flay instead of Lacus. I said last time that Lacus is the worst character in this show, but Flay ultimately has the equal and opposite flaw - I'm jumping the gun a little here, but we'll soon see her being presented as outright evil. We already see seeds of this - the music and framing put a remarkably negative slant on the sentiment Gundam usually regards as most laudable - her desire to end the war.

A better show would contrast the two approaches - Lacus' absolutist idealism, Flay's ruthless pragmatism - like Suzaku and Lelouch in *Code Geass*. Both have (notionally) the same goal, and both are trying to achieve it in their own way.
