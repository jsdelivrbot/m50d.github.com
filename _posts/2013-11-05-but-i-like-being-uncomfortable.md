Well, this is awkward.

Ever since I read [this post](http://formeinfullbloom.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/what-not-to-wear-undressing-kill-la-kills-wardrobe-nsfw/) I've felt I should write some kind of reply. ajthefourth offers a sympathetic take on *Kill La Kill*, one that accepts its eroticism as a valuable thematic choice, one that even female viewers can understand and appreciate.

And I'm going to crap all over that.

Satsuki has indeed chosen to own what she wears. She feels no shame in her exposure; she's strong without losing her femininity (unless you're the kind of extreme traditionalist who holds that shyness is an inherent part of being a proper female)
