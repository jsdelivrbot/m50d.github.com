"You can't ban bitcoin, you'd have to make mathematics illegal!" is the all-too-frequent reply to those of us who [want the cryptocurrency to die](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html). And it's true, more-or-less; while we can prosecute people who are living above their declared-for-taxation means, there's little we can do to stop two or more people who keep their balance of payments neutral from sending numbers back and forth.

What I don't get, though, is why any upstanding citizen would want to help them out.

Bitcoin is, as Stross describes, a currency designed to facilitate illegal transactions.
