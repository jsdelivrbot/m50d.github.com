"You can't ban bitcoin, you'd have to make mathematics illegal!" is the all-too-frequent reply to those of us who [want the cryptocurrency to die](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html). And it's true, more-or-less; while we can prosecute people who are living above their declared-for-taxation means, there's little we can do to stop two or more people who keep their balance of payments neutral from sending numbers back and forth.

What I don't get, though, is why any upstanding citizen would want to help them out.

Like any currency, a bitcoin behaves like an uncopyable token; the usual economic cycle is that a user buys bitcoins with money (from someone with a large supply - more on that later), and uses them to buy goods or services from a seller - who then sells the bitcoins on to the next user in exchange for cold hard cash. (Bitcoin's advocates speak hopefully of a bitcoin-native economy where the seller would keep their wealth in bitcoins and use them to pay for regular purchases like food and clothing, but that's purely aspirational at this stage)

The one unique twist is that, being purely mathematical, it's possible to send these tokens over the internet as easily as sending an email - not an instruction for your bank to move money from your account into theirs, but the actual, nonphysical bitcoins. In many ways it behaves like cash - cash you can hand over in cyberspace.

Which is all well and good, but it comes at a time when actual cash has been sinking into obsolesence. I don't think I paid for anything in cash last week - why would I, when a credit card is both more convenient and safer (not to mention the rewards)?\[2\] Companies hate doing business in cash, [using it only when forced to](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26248396). Partly this is because it's bulky and cumbersome to audit, issues that won't necessarily affect bitcoin - though people are already concerned about the computing power needed to participate in the bitcoin network, and MtGox's spectacular collapse shows some of the difficulties with accounting for large numbers of bitcoins. But the main reason respectable companies don't do business in cash is security. If someone steals your cash, it's very difficult to get the transfer reversed, or even discover who they were, because it's an anonymous[1] bearer instrument - the very properties that bitcoin, by design, emulates.

The biggest use of cash is for criminals - to the extent that [most $100 bills contain detectable traces of cocaine](http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/14/cocaine.traces.money/).

Bitcoin is, as Stross describes, a currency designed to facilitate illegal transactions. For in-person transactions, it's slower than cash[3]; for legitimate internet transactions, it's less convenient and less safe for the consumer than credit cards[5]. The one legitimate purpose Bitcoin advocates make a case for is moving money abroad - buying bitcoins in local currency, transferring them over the internet to one's cousin abroad, who then sells them for her own local currency, can be cheaper than an international bank transfer. Bitcoin is acting as a sort of TODO: THAT SERVICE here, allowing you to avoid having to match exactly with someone moving money in the opposite direction. But as soon as we think about it in those terms the advantage disappears: why not just use TODO? True, they change a fee of their own - but so will any service for buying and selling bitcoins, and you'll have to pay two sets of fees doing the transfer the bitcoin way. (You might be able to avoid this by buying and selling bitcoins for cash, but the time and expense of meeting someone to do this will outweigh the TODO fees for small amounts - and for larger amounts, meeting a stranger carrying that much cash is rather perilous).

(Surprisingly, I *don't* see bitcoin advocates arguing for using bitcoin to buy embarrassing things online, or donate anonymously. TODO: THINK ABOUT THIS MORE)

Everything I've written above is true for some imaginary future in which Bitcoin is an established, stable currency. In fact, right now it's enormously volatile,

Bitcoin, then, is good for one thing: criminal transactions that are conducted or at least arranged over the internet.

[1] More or less - cash has serial numbers. Bitcoin goes one better - you can see the whole transaction history of any given "coin". But the "addresses" used in any given transaction are just random strings of numbers - it's not easy to connect them to a legal identity you can file a lawsuit against - and the "community" that sells products for bitcoins seems to have no qualms about accepting stolen bitcoins in payment.

[2] Yes, sellers pay fees to accept credit card payments. But (TODO: LINK TO THAT AUSTRALIA STORY) when those fees go down, they don't pass the savings on to customers. So TODO: FINISH THIS REASONING

[3] Some advocates say that using a smartphone with bitcoin eliminates the inconvenience of having to withdraw cash. This is true, but only if your phone has access to your entire bitcoin wallet - practically equivalent to carrying around your life's savings in cash[4]. Otherwise, you still have the hassle of remembering to load up your phone wallet with enough bitcoin before you go shopping.

[4] Admittedly it's less physically cumbersome than that much cash - but no less dangerous.

[5] The seller is in some respects safer - so safe, they can take the money and run without delivering a product, as one Silk Road seller did TODO: LINK AND DETAILS. TALK A BIT ABOUT ANTIFRAUD AND JAY'S STUFF FROM AMAZON (GUARANTEED SELLING AT 1% FEE OR SO).
