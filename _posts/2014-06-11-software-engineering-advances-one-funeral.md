#Software Engineering Advances One Funeral at a Time

[This lament from a Perl programmer](http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2014/02/the-mid-career-crisis-of-the-perl-programmer.html) has been doing the rounds.
I take a little too much glee in the demise of Perl, because it was the first language I truly hated. And yet my own preferred language has been described as [Perl 8](http://perl8.org), and not without some justification.

I believe, deeply and truly, that some languages are better than others; that new languages are usually (though not always) better than those they replace.
