Of all the secondary characters in *Gundam Seed*, I wish we saw more of Badriguel. Unlike the milquetoast cadets, she's willing - possibly too willing - to contradict everyone, even the captain. She has her own beliefs - she must have hopes and dreams and fears to explore - but all too often she's cast as the impersonal voice of military discipline. Certainly that was the only way I remembered her from watching the show as a 20-year-old.

The dichotomy between the younger and older "generations" (probably less than ten years apart; I suspect most of the "old" characters are now younger than me) is an infuriating case: I admire the ambition, but the show never delivers. As always, there just isn't enough time given to it: the dichotomy between Earth and Zaft forces could have made for an interesting dynamic, as could that between young and old on a single side, but the show doesn't have time to do both at once - at least, not if it's going to fit in the number of robot fights it has. We have dozens of half-baked secondary characters, and even our primary cast aren't really characterized that well - as Athrun puts it, Kira is a wishy-washy crybaby, which are awkward characteristics to build an action show around.

Ramius is, more or less, a real character - in the sense that I as a viewer care about her, in contrast to Badriguel or Mu or Rau or any other "grownup". She's on fine form this episode, treading a delicate path between caring for her crew and making the tough choices that are necessary for survival. Her conversation with Mu - tears in her eyes, but still ultimately giving an order - was genuinely touching. But even in her case I wish we had more time for characterisation. Conversations between her and the engineering chief takes on a different cast if they're still sleeping together, but it's been so many episodes since we touched on that that I'd honestly forgotten that plot point until I came to write this. I'd far rather spend time on that than Izak or Deakka's posturing, for all that their actions this episode are faithful to those characters; ultimately I don't care about either of them, because they're never going to be developed. It's strange to expect more growth from the adults than the children, but it seems to be true for *Gundam Seed*.
