My resolution is to blog every day. Whoops, already missed that one. Make it every week, I guess.

Also, to finally launch the enormous white whale of a ship that I've been working on in Kerbal Space Program (which is what has kept me from here for so long). It will set all sorts of records, visit all the planets... I just need to have the damn thing not explode. I'm getting closer now; got as far as 20km, and the most recent launch was spoiled by pure bad luck (a piece I'd blown off the top of my rocket fell down back onto it).

You might think stuff like buying a flat or finding a job should be higher on the list than achieving something in a computer game. And you'd be right. But damned if it doesn't feel like the other way around.
