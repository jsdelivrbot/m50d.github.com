title: Marking Time (Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere episode 21)
---

As usual, this week's *Horizon* contained both a lot, and nothing at all. I think the entire episode took place inside Queen Elizabeth's throne room, with barely a weapon drawn (just a body pillow, honest).

But in truth this show has long been about the politics more than the battles. The first series spent at least ten episodes on Toori figuring out what to do, only setting out to fight for the finale.
