A show in this format is more than usually subjective, but I can only review my own experience. That said, I listened to Punchdrunk, and followed their advice to the letter; I went alone, I wandered and explored, not systematically but at random, consciously forgetting what I knew about what could be found where. If there was a better way to experience the show (and certainly I ment people who'd stuck with their friends, or followed the main characters, and seemed to have had a better time of it), I feel the fault is with them more than me.
