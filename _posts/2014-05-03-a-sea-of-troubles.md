A show in this format is more than usually subjective, but I can only review my own experience. That said, I listened to Punchdrunk, and followed their advice to the letter; I went alone, I wandered and explored, not systematically but at random, consciously forgetting what I knew about what could be found where. If there was a better way to experience the show (and certainly I ment people who'd stuck with their friends, or followed the main characters, and seemed to have had a better time of it), I feel the fault is with them more than me.

Partly I was just unlucky. I didn't find the bar until the very end, and had some difficulty finding toilets (partly my fault, but partly due to poor directions from staff), which in turn meant I missed most of the finale. But I doubt said finale would have changed my judgement overmuch, because I wasn't waiting for a resolution - indeed I'd barely put together any coherent narrative or even characterization. I followed one character after another, magpie-like, and saw vignettes, individual isolated snippets. But even when I followed the same character for a while it felt like I was seeing scenes from several different stories that had nothing to do with each other. I gravitated to the cafe and watched the waitress taking her rollerskates on and off just to have some kind of center to connect things to - but while I discovered much of her (no doubt intricately choreographed) cycle, I was left none the wiser as to what was supposed to be going on.

Choreography is where *The Drowned Man* works. If you're a fan of dance there were some very cool physical routines - the silent argument mixed with intimacy from the lovers on and around their car, the two people who meet in the empty desert and throwing sand into the air as they twirl, the full-scale cheerleader routine that seemingly half the cast sneaks into.
