title: Making Mkphlog Work

Sadly it seems like the SDF doesn't support dynamic gopher content - despite its claims to the contrary. So I guess I'm down to using scripts to generate my posts. Which would be fine if markdown were a natively supported gopher
format, but it isn't. So as far as I can tell my only option is to preconvert markdown to HTML and treat that html as a gophermap, which I don't like because it's nonreversible.

Or I could make all posts be plain text.
