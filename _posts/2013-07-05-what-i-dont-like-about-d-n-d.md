title: "What I Don't Like About D&D"
---

I've been thinking a lot about RPG systems lately, partly because I'm GMing for the first time in years, partly in response to [this](http://susd.pretend-money.com/blog/2013/6/27/monster-hearts/). I've enjoyed D&D - its flaws can be mitigated, and good friends can hame a good time doing almost any activity. But of all the systems I've played (and some systemless games), I've probably enjoyed D&D the least. I do not say this lightly.

##Mechanics
 * Your character's abilities are dominated by the first six dice rolls you make during creation. Roll well and you can claim the spotlight by force, roll badly and you are forever mechanically weaker than the rest of the party.
