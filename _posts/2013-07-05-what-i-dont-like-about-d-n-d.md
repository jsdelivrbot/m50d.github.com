title: "What I Don't Like About D&D"
---

I've been thinking a lot about RPG systems lately, partly because I'm GMing for the first time in years, partly in response to [this](http://susd.pretend-money.com/blog/2013/6/27/monster-hearts/). I've enjoyed D&D - its flaws can be mitigated, and good friends can hame a good time doing almost any activity. But of all the systems I've played (and some systemless games), I've probably enjoyed D&D the least. I do not say this lightly.

##Mechanics
 * Your character's abilities are dominated by your stats, the first six dice rolls you make during creation. Roll well and you can claim the spotlight by force, roll badly and you are forever mechanically weaker than the rest of the party
 
Playing a weaker character can be fun as a roleplaying choice. But having it forced upon you is not, at least for me. Yes, you can mitigate against it by being clever in your actions, by having interesting character quirks, by - when all else fails - minmaxing like hell. But *players who rolled higher stats can do all these things too*. Yes, the rules say that the very worst stats can be mulliganed, but that only shifts the line for where the worst rolls are. The fundamental problem - that there's a randomly imposed power imbalance in the party which is substantial and *permanent*, remains.

 * The flat probability curve doesn't have any truly extreme results
