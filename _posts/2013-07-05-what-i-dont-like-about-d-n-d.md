title: "What I Don't Like About D&D"
---

I've been thinking a lot about RPG systems lately, partly because I'm GMing for the first time in years, partly in response to [this](http://susd.pretend-money.com/blog/2013/6/27/monster-hearts/). I've enjoyed D&D - its flaws can be mitigated, and good friends can hame a good time doing almost any activity. But of all the systems I've played (and some systemless games), I've probably enjoyed D&D the least. I do not say this lightly.

##Mechanics
 * Your character's abilities are dominated by your stats, the first six dice rolls you make during creation. Roll well and you can claim the spotlight by force, roll badly and you are forever mechanically weaker than the rest of the party
 
Playing a weaker character can be fun as a roleplaying choice. But having it forced upon you is not, at least for me.

Yes, you can mitigate against it by being clever in your actions, by having interesting character quirks, by - when all else fails - minmaxing like hell. But *players who rolled higher stats can do all these things too*. Yes, the group should balance spotlight between characters - but when one character is much better than another at most tasks, it's not really practical (you could tailor challenges to the weaker characters' strong points - but that would, quite rightly, draw complaints from everyone else).

Yes, the rules say that the very worst stats can be mulliganed, but that only shifts the line for where the worst rolls are. The fundamental problem - that there's a randomly imposed power imbalance in the party which is substantial and *permanent*, remains.

 * The flat probability curve doesn't have any extreme results
 
The only point of having randomness in a game is so that you can occasionally be surprised. I tend to have a pretty low rate of dice rolling in my games - it's not unusual to go half an hour without rolling any, and most conflicts are resolved in one or two throws - but when I ask for one there should be a chance of something that I didn't expect. Otherwise what's the point?

With D&D every outcome has a 5% chance. Which is reasonably unlikely, but not *that* unlikely, particularly if you're rolling at the frequencies that are typical in a D&D game. There's a mythology built up around the natural 20, but it's something you can expect to happen every so often. You don't get the "epic" rolls that you still talk about months later, like the time I rolled 350 in HARP, or my hextruple-fumble in Promethean.

Put it another way: as GM, in D&D I can set a success probability of 5%, 10%, .... Contrast with e.g. GURPS, where there are fewer numbers you might roll (16 rather than 20). But the probabilities I can set are 0.46%, 1.9%, 4.6%.... Of course, this doesn't come for free; around the middle values the distribution is more spread out, so e.g. I can't choose anything between 38% and 50%.  But for narrative purposes that's the right tradeoff; the difference between 0.5% and 2% is much more interesting than the difference between 35% and 40%.
