I've been thinking a lot about RPG systems lately, partly because I'm GMing for the first time in years, partly in response to [this](http://susd.pretend-money.com/blog/2013/6/27/monster-hearts/). I've enjoyed D&D - its flaws can be mitigated, and good friends can hame a good time doing almost any activity. But of all the systems I've played (and some systemless games), I've probably enjoyed D&D the least. I do not say this lightly.

## The Problems

* Unless you're very lucky, your party will be unbalanced

Your character's abilities are dominated by your stats, the first six dice rolls you make during creation. Roll well and you can claim the spotlight by force, roll badly and you are forever mechanically weaker than the rest of the party
 
Playing a weaker character can be fun as a roleplaying choice. But having it forced upon you is not, at least for me.

Yes, you can mitigate against it by being clever in your actions, by having interesting character quirks, by - when all else fails - minmaxing like hell. But *players who rolled higher stats can do all these things too*. Yes, the group should balance spotlight between characters - but when one character is much better than another at most tasks, it's not really practical (you could tailor challenges to the weaker characters' strong points - but that would, quite rightly, draw complaints from everyone else).

Yes, the rules say that the very worst stats can be mulliganed, but that only shifts the line for where the worst rolls are. The fundamental problem - that there's a randomly imposed power imbalance in the party which is substantial and *permanent*, remains. I've put this one at the top not because its effects are worse than the other things on this page, but because the only way to avoid it is to turn your game into something that's *not D&D*.

* The rules encourage a lot of tedious bookkeeping

Perhaps this is personal preference, but many of the things D&D encourages you to keep track of are simply not interesting. I'll admit that occasionally it's nice to be able to anticipate buying a particular awesome item and gradually save up the loot for it. But does anyone actually enjoy calculating their encumberance? Worse, a lot of the time people treat the equipment list as a way for the GM to "gotcha" a player who forgot to write down something - and that's no fun for anyone.

My preferred approach is to assume everyone's taken a reasonable set of gear for whatever they're doing, and if it becomes important whether or not a character has a certain thing, ask their player. If they *want* to say their character always has the Bat-Shark-repellent or whatever item would get them out of this encounter, fine - it's their own fun they're spoiling. But in my experience if you treat players as collaborators in your story they respond in kind, and won't mind taking a dive from time to time to keep things interesting.

Explicitly calculating experience from each encounter makes sense in a computer game, where the machine can do it for you, but the cost/benefit is too poor to do it by hand. It's even worse if you keep track of individual characters separately, as you end up with a vicious circle: some characters are better at combat (perhaps because they rolled higher stats ), so they're able to fight more and take part in more encounters, so they get more experience, widening the gap between them and weaker characters. In my games, the party levels up together if at all, and I tell them to do so when it seems narratively appropriate rather than when the entries we've added up in a table somewhere say so.

Fortunately, you can do all this in D&D too - just drop the encumberance rools, stop writing down loot/experience, tell your players to be sensible about what they're carrying and when to level up. It doesn't change the "feel" of the game, doesn't make it "not D&D" - it just removes a few of the boring bits and lets you spend more time on the fun stuff.

* The rules focus on combat, so the game focuses on combat

Even with the heavy simplification many groups do, the complexity of D&D's combat ruleset still dwarfs what it offers for anything else.

* The flat probability curve doesn't have any extreme results
 
The only point of having randomness in a game is so that you can occasionally be surprised. I tend to have a pretty low rate of dice rolling in my games - it's not unusual to go half an hour without rolling any, and most conflicts are resolved in one or two throws - but when I ask for one there should be a chance of something that I didn't expect. Otherwise what's the point?

With D&D every outcome has a 5% chance. Which is reasonably unlikely, but not *that* unlikely, particularly if you're rolling at the frequencies that are typical in a D&D game. There's a mythology built up around the natural 20, but it's something you can expect to happen every so often. You don't get the "epic" rolls that you still talk about months later, like the time I rolled 350 in HARP and sliced through four pig-men with one blow, or the hextruple-fumble in Promethean where I not only shot off my own leg, but that of the PC next to me as well.

Put it another way: as GM, in D&D I can set a success probability of 5%, 10%, .... Contrast with e.g. GURPS, where there are fewer numbers you might roll (16 rather than 20). But the probabilities I can set are 0.46%, 1.9%, 4.6%.... Of course, this doesn't come for free; around the middle values the distribution is more spread out, so e.g. I can't choose anything between 38% and 50%. But for narrative purposes that's the right tradeoff; the difference between 0.5% and 2% is much more interesting than the difference between 35% and 40%.

* Six stats is too many to be balanced

If a system is to have stats then they should be balanced. As the complexity of the system increases this becomes ever more important, because the system will be taking up an increasing proportion of player time - D&D certainly falls into this category. But to do this means ensuring the six stats are used equally, which is quite simply *too hard*. So each group ends up with its own specific "balance" - e.g. CHA is used more or less than average, which in turn means sorcerors are more or less powerful. As with my first point, that can make for an interesting game when done deliberately, but is no fun to force onto players.

* Setting
It's easier for sci-fi settings to emulate fantasy than the other way around, because the difference between the two genres is that science fiction expects a consistent explanation behind everything, while fantasy is more or less indifferent to this. So you could easily adapt something like *Eclipse Phase* (which is a deeply sci-fi game, more firmly embedded in the genre than most) to a fantasy setting - the TITANS were, well, Titans, that escaped the magical control they were under. Storing memories in stones and passing them between bodies is easy, and it's always been like that. Mechanical golem bodies are worn only by the poor, the rich always use human (or magically enhanced human, or human-animal magical crossbreed) bodies, and there's a healthy black market in supplying fresh, uninhabited bodies, even if you have to evict the current occupant first. All that works perfectly well in fantasy.
But going in the other direction and adapting a fantasy setting you can only ever reach very light, space-operaey sci-fi. You can't just declare a Minkowsky Particle and explain all the magic in terms of it, because fantasy magic systems haven't been designed with this in mind.

little about anything else. Which means that even if it makes up a small proportion of your game time, most real time will be spent making combat rolls. I remember one particular campaign which was a fascinating story of political intrigue in a pseudo-Venetian setting, with various factions vying for control of the court, the merchants trying to increase their own power, the ruler barely more than a figurehead but with his own vision for what the city-state should do... it really was amazing. But most sessions we'd spend an hour or so exploring this wonderful stuff, and then someone's guards would rush in or we'd spot a thief in the street, and suddenly everything ground to a halt for twenty minutes as we trudged through the combat rolls - and after that it was always a bit harder to get back into the mindset we'd started with.

This one's relatively easy to fix, and my experience is many groups already have their ways of dealing with it: once it's clear how a combat's going to go, there's no need to roll out every single action the way the leter of the rules say. Feel free to cut it down to a smaller number of rolls, or - for minor encounters that are intended for flavour rather than to pose a challenge to the PCs - do away with the rolling altogether.

* Aside: small-scale minatures wargames

I've sometimes heard that the D&D rules were originally written for a small-scale wargame, with minatures, one squad per player - something like *Necromuda*. Certainly the feel is similar, so whether the story is actually true is almost irrelevant.

The funny thing is, I like *Necromuda*. (And ironically enough its biggest problem is similar: its rules are an adaptation of those for a larger-scale wargame, and don't always work for small squads). So I feel obliged to explain why D&D doesn't succeed on the same level.
