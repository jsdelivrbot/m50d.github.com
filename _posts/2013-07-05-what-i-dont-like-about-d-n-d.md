title: "What I Don't Like About D&D"
---

I've been thinking a lot about RPG systems lately, partly because I'm GMing for the first time in years, partly in response to [this](http://susd.pretend-money.com/blog/2013/6/27/monster-hearts/). I've enjoyed D&D - its flaws can be mitigated, and good friends can hame a good time doing almost any activity. But of all the systems I've played (and some systemless games), I've probably enjoyed D&D the least. I do not say this lightly.
