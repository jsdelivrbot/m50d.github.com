The traditional history of "the web" places Mozilla and the W3C as its leading lights, as the organizations that pushed for standards that made modern web development possible.

But my experience is just the opposite. I've never liked the web, but the web of the '90s, with its competing browser vendors, produced some valuable things, and the web of the late '00s produced some brilliant innovations... innovations for which the W3C and Mozilla have been more of a barrier than an asset. Their very insensitivity to commercial considerations allows Mozilla to get away with behaviour that a browser which had to chase user numbers would never dare. They are, in short, the enemy of the web.
