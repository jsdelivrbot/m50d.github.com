If we're living in a functional programming renaissance, no word emblemizes it more than "monad" - for fans and skeptics alike. Arguments rage over whether monads are indispensible tools or pointless sophistry; you'd wonder whether people were even talking about the same thing. I suspect that, largely, they aren't.

As Alan Perlis said, a language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing. A programming language should be a thesis, or a manifesto: a controversial claim about programming. The Haskell manifesto goes something like:

 1. Some very simple structures occur lots of times in lots of programs, and particular manipulations of those structures are done again and again; we can make programs simpler by providing libraries for operating on these structures.
