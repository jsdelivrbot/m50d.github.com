title: Strength of Character (Gundam Seed 18)
---
A man is known by the company he keeps - perhaps *Gundam Seed* wants us to know Cagalli. This episode spends the first third dealing with the attack on the town and its aftermath, and devotes the remainder to a surprisingly long set-piece battle.

In many ways this is the flipside of the previous episode: as a robot show it works. The burning town driving them forward, the warband makes their bold but futile attack, losing several of their number before Kira arrives to rescue them in a nice reprisal of their first encounter.
