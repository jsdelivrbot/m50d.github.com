title: Strength of Character (Gundam Seed 18)
---
A man is known by the company he keeps - perhaps *Gundam Seed* wants us to know Cagalli. This episode spends the first third dealing with the attack on the town and its aftermath, and devotes the remainder to a surprisingly long set-piece battle.

As an action sequence I can't fault it.
