title: The Hardest Kind of Prediction
---

Prediction is hard, especially about the future. Here's a few guesses about what life will be like 30 years from now, to see whether I can do better than Heinlein.

1. Boxing will be illegal in several European countries
2. The keyboard will be the primary computer input device for programming and extended writing
3. Developed nations will not be fighting any full-scale wars
4. Computers will pass the turing test in its original form. No computers will be widely recognized as intelligent or thinking
5. Gays and transsexuals will be largely accepted, at least in public; overt discrimination or mockery will be socially unacceptable. Jokes will be told about some fresh set of minorities
6. Women will achieve wage parity in parts of Europe, but not in America
7. Large regions of Africa will be dependent on outside aid, whether through charity or some more neocolonial arrangement
8. The pub quiz will be essentially dead as a form of entertainment, surviving only among hipsters
9. The pub will be essentially dead as a form of entertainment, surviving only among hipsters
10. Cannabis will be legal in much of Europe. Both it and alcohol will be seen as morally dubious. Even caffeine will be looked on with suspicion.
11. Self-producing a movie at hollywood-equivalent quality will be a real option, and one taken by a few geek heroes every year. Most movies will continue to be produced through a small number of big-name studios.
