title: The Hardest Kind of Prediction
---

Prediction is hard, especially about the future. Here's a few guesses about what life will be like 30 years from now, to see whether I can do better than Heinlein.

1. Boxing will be illegal in several European countries
2. The keyboard will remain the primary computer input device for programming and extended writing
3. Developed nations will not be fighting any full-scale wars
4. There will be computers which pass the turing test in its original form. There will be no computers widely recognized as intelligent or thinking
5. Gays and transsexuals will be largely accepted, at least in public; overt discrimination or mockery will be socially unacceptable. Jokes will be told about some fresh set of minorities
6. Women will achieve wage parity in parts of Europe, but not in America
7. Large regions of Africa will be dependent on outside aid, whether through charity or some more neocolonial arrangement
