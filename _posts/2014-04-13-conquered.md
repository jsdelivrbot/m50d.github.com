Few studios are less consistent than A1 Pictures. Who would believe that the artsy, provocative *Shinsekai Yori* came from the same place as the pedestrian *Space Brothers* - and those are notionally shows from the same genre. Aside from high-quality animation (a legacy of their days as part of Kyoto Animation), it's not at all clear what A1 stands for.

*Sekai Seifuku: B≈çryaku no Zvezda* is a microcosm of this confusion. The plot sounds like a five-minute joke - eleven-year-old wants to conquer the world.
