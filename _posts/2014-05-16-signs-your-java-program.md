## The code is too verbose / noisy

This is perhaps the most trivial reason, but it's the reason I started using Scala. Generics inference in Java 7 and lambdas in Java 8 have closed some of the gap, but Scala is still a substantially more concise language. With full type inference and the ability to omit the visual clutter of braces or semicolons, it's possible to write something close to Python. In fact the "\_" syntax for very short lambdas is something I wish Python would adopt.
