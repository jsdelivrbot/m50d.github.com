There's been a bit of fuss around Scala on Hacker News this week, which ultimately pointed me towards [some more useful criticism (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1lpKBMkgg). I'm reminded of [Zed Shaw's complaints about the web and OOP](http://vimeo.com/43380467) - in both cases I agree with the criticism, but firmly disagree with the proposed solutions.
