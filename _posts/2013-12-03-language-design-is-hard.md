title: "Language Design is Hard. Let's Go Shopping"

There's been a bit of fuss around Scala on Hacker News this week, which ultimately pointed me towards [some more useful criticism (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1lpKBMkgg). I'm reminded of [Zed Shaw's complaints about the web and OOP](http://vimeo.com/43380467) - in both cases I agree with the criticism, but disagree with the proposed solutions. So I want to talk about why Scala is my favourite language, and what I'd do to makea better one.

Where Philipps starts to go wrong, I think, is about 2/3 of the way through his video, where he says that for a typical project we have maybe four layers of languages involved: Ant XML, Java, and Scala. Leaving aside the questionable arithmetic, this is simply false for modern Scala projects: it's very much possible to write a modern project in pure scala, with no Java anywhere, and with SBT your build is configured in Scala too. And that's not all; things that would be another format in Java are handled in pure Scala. Squeryl's Table models are normal code, where Hibernate would be configured with annotations or XML. Spray-json serializers are again ordinary scala, as opposed to Jackson's annotation approach. Play does use a separate route-mapping file and I consider this a mark against it; at my work this was a substantial factor in our choice of Spray instead. In Spray, your endpoint declarations are, once again, simply code.

To a certain extent, you get this in Python (and Ruby, as I understand it). Your build system is python; your Django models are python classes, and your routes are configured with a mix of code and decorators - and unlike Java annotations, decorators have well-defined semantics in Python, so this is really just pure python code.
