When it comes to anim√©, *Anna Karenina* got it wrong. Every great show is great in its own way - but terrible shows are all alike. *Akuma no Riddle* is such a show.

This very blandness makes it hard to describe, or even to think about. I'm writing the day after I was subjected to yet another episode of this travesty. It's dull, yes, *Michiko to Hatchin* levels - but many shows are dull, including some that I would defend (*Ergo Proxy* comes to mind). Its episodes are formulaic, attacker-of-the-week stuff - but so are shows I count among my favourites (*Absolutely Lovely Children*).
