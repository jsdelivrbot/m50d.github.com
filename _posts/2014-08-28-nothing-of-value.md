When it comes to anim√©, *Anna Karenina* got it wrong. Every great show is great in its own way - but terrible shows are all alike. *Akuma no Riddle* is such a show[1].

This very blandness makes it hard to describe, or even to think about. I'm writing the day after I was subjected to yet another episode of this travesty. It's dull, yes, *Michiko to Hatchin* levels - but many shows are dull, including some that I would defend (*Ergo Proxy* comes to mind). Its episodes are formulaic, attacker-of-the-week stuff - but so are shows I count among my favourites (*Absolutely Lovely Children*).  Its production (particularly animation) is at a level of shoddiness I'd call disappointing if there were any merit to the rest of the series - but it's no worse in that regard than, say, *Sakura Trick*. And while I wouldn't call that show *good*, per se, its pleasant world and cute characters meant I felt at least some positive emotions while watching.

Characters are one place where the flaws with *Akuma no Riddle* are clearer. I've long thought that thirteen episodes is time for about four fully developed characters; more and you can't characterize them enough, fewer and there's too little to work with. *Akuma no Riddle* makes a valiant attempt to split the difference, with a lead couple supported by a series of one-episode antagonists. It ought to work; *Katanagatari*, which we're watching in parallel, pulls this off beautifully (admittedly with twice as much time to work with).

But it falls flat because of the incredibly crude characterization. Everyone, leads included, is thoroughly one-dimensional, and the attempts at backstory have the grace and subtlety of a brick to the head. We see one girl's friend/mentor dying in her arms - but with no sense of who either of them are beyond this, no idea what they're fighting for or why they care about each other, it falls flat. We see the dozen girls who another antagonist regards as family - but no actual interaction between them. It says something when the serial killer who kills because she enjoys it comes across as one of the more well-rounded and better realized characters.

[1] I'm basing this off five episodes' watching; while I will unfortunately be socially obliged to watch the remainder, I'm happy to declare it irredeemable. More to the point, I need to express my burning rage and hate.
