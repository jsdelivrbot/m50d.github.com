Man, this show likes its recaps - 26 and 27 were (mostly) recap episodes, and while this episode is new content, thematically it's a retread of everything that already characterizes Kira - not least his relationship with Athrun.

Partly it's a reminder that, despite how modern it can feel at times, *Gundam Seed* is approaching 15 years old; it has its roots in an era where viewers couldn't be assumed to have watched every previous episode.
