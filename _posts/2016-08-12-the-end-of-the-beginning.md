title: The End of the Beginning (Gundam Seed 21)

So, farewell then, Wartfeld. Honestly I wasn't expecting to lose him so soon - his popularity belies how few episodes he's present for. Like Lancer in *Fate/Stay Night*, he turns up, acts very cool, and dies before he can start to grate.

This is a return not just to plot but to action - predictably something I feel lukewarm about.
