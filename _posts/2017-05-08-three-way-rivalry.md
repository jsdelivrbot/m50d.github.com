Also there was some stuff with mobile suits.

In all seriousness this was an excellent episode. I was worried I'd've lost track of the plot over my few months' break, but the opening set-piece battle was immediately relatable, as weird as that sounds. The desperation of Archangel facing off against impossible odds makes it instantly clear which side is sympathetic; on the other side and Athrun and Yzak's rivalry is probably the first real piece of characterization we've had. As basic as it is, it makes a lot of difference: we feel Yzak's frustration at being placed under the thumb of some politically-connected kid even as we see exactly why Athrun's much more fit for command. Likewise the EDF crew demonstrate - barely - enough cleverness to justify their escape from overwhelming odds, via intelligent tactics, discipline, and the timely intervention of a foreign power.

The second half was weaker, but only just. Orb's internal political discussions are stretched out just enough to convey how tedious they are to the participants without becoming so to the viewer, and I liked that
