Also there was some stuff with mobile suits.

In all seriousness this was an excellent episode. I was worried I'd've lost track of the plot over my few months' break, but the opening set-piece battle was immediately relatable, as weird as that sounds. The desperation of Archangel facing off against impossible odds makes it instantly clear which side is sympathetic; on the other side and Athrun and Yzak's rivalry is probably the first real piece of characterization we've had. As basic as it is, it makes a lot of difference: we feel Yzak's frustration at being placed under the thumb of some politically-connected kid even as we see exactly why Athrun's much more fit for command.
