Maybe I'm getting old, but this has been a singularly poor animé season. (Winter is always the worst; hopefully something good will arrive with the spring). But on the plus side, it's given me a chance to catch up on two shows I'd missed, both of which are turning out to be surprisingly beautiful - in more ways than one.

First, and perhaps less surprising, *The Legend of Korra*. The original *Avatar: The Last Airbender* was truly groundbreaking. It was proof that western animation can deliver a story every bit as nuanced, engaging, and epic as animé - without losing sight of its own traditions. It wasn't perfect - some of its finest episodes (*Sokka's Master* and *The Puppetmaster*) could have done with more foreshadowing - and while the creators have fun with their inability to portray death, it damages the story in places. But it rightly remains a classic, even outside the medium; a sequel coming so late seemed more likely to be a cash-in than a valuable addition.

Right from the off we see the world has changed. Republic City is a true metropolis, openly evoking New York (particularly the gratuitous statue in the bay), or perhaps Gotham; it's an age of motor cars and gangsters and the wireless, what many would call "dieselpunk" - although the attitude is a long way from punk.
