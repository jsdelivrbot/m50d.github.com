Maybe I'm getting old, but this has been a singularly poor anim√© season. (Winter is always the worst; hopefully something good will arrive with the spring). But on the plus side, it's given me a chance to catch up on two shows I'd missed, both of which are turning out to be surprisingly beautiful - in more ways than one.
