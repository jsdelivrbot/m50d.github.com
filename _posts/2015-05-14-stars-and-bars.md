I remembered this episode rather less well than the previous one, but I enjoyed it a lot more. It's another in-between episode (something I fear we're in for a lot of), at least in the sense of not having (much of) a robot fight.  But rather than attempt a standalone plot, it's an exploration that adds colour to our main characters.

Athrun's encouter with his father was a real highlight, feeling astonishingly true-to-life - perhaps something I appreciate more now than I did as a student. His superiors treat him with genuine respect - Rau's comment about his testimony has some real warmth behind it (and he too starts to feel like more of a complete character) - but they don't entirely trust him yet. More importantly, he's only beginning to learn the unwritten "how we do things here". Athrun responds maturely to the conflict between official and unofficial practice (better than I did in my first job) - going along with his father's plans for now, but also making his unhappiness clear.

Again I'm impressed at the political pieces being put into place early - both Orb's reaction to the destruction of their colony and Athrun's engagement to Lacus are threads we will be picking up later. I've always felt their relationship was underdeveloped, but I suppose that's largely the point - theirs is a political union, not the fire of true love. It underscores how important Athrun is - raising the question of what he's doing on the front lines, but maybe there are principles at stake here. Regardless, I'm really liking what I see of his character this time around; he's reasonable and competent, without ever seeming overpowered.
