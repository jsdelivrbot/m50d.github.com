title: Why did you make me hit you? (Doki Doki Literature Club)
---
(My experience with Doki Doki Literature Club; spoilers ahead)

00:00 The game asked my name, but everyone keeps talking to me as if I'm male. In my head I mentally rewrite the pronouns they use so that I can pretend I'm a girl. I do the same thing in the game.

00:05 Meet Sayori, the childhood friend character; she's the classic cheerful/always-late-for-school type. She seems nice. I don't like the tiny eyes these character designs have, but that's a minor gripe.

00:30 Ok, the poem-writing mechanic is an interesting semi-choice mechanism, and surprisingly fun - it actually captures the feeling of writing a poem while being much easier, which is what games should do. The other characters' poems are... not great works of literature, but believeable as the kind of thing high-schoolers would like, and they have their moments.

I'm kinda-sorta aiming for Sayori's route, but early on the childish/nerd character Natsuki gets into an argument with the mature/sophisticated/literary character, Yuki, and to my surprise I find myself taking her side. Natsuki actually makes a solid argument for herself, and it more or less aligns with my own philosophy of literature: while I would certainly say there's value metaphor and applicability, I think the first duty of a work is to be effective on the surface level (I detest obscurantism). Plus she's into manga like me. Hey, I'm a simple person with simple tastes.

00:45 The other shoe in starting to drop: I'm getting increasingly unsubtle hints about problems in Natsuki's home life. Guess this must be the dark side I've been hearing this game has; I went in without outright spoilers as such, but with an awareness that there was something to be spoiled. Monika tells me I should save before important decisions, as if I've never played a game before.

01:00 The game tells me directly that Sayori has depression. I haven't seen much of Yuri or Monika (the club president who writes nonsense poems; I'm guessing she's the crazy one) yet but I assume they will have similar stories on their routes. While it's good to see this stuff getting coverage, in a game this short I'm not sure the characters are established enough to carry it; they're dangerously close to being defined entirely by their problems. This then creates a bit of a gap between what I'm supposed to feel and what I do feel. In-game Sayori is a life-long friend who I care deeply about; out-of-game I met her an hour ago and while she's been perfectly pleasant there's very little substance to our relationship. (And since the game has just deliberately subverted its own characterization shorthand - ). It's the same kind of forced tragedy as when stories introduce a character just to kill them off. At the time I don't think this explicitly; I'm aware this is a short game and try to bear with the limits of that format.

01:05 And now I'm given a very explicit choice between Sayori and- well, actually between Sayori and not-Sayori, but Natsuki is implicit. The thing is, by this point I actually like Natsuki more; I'm pretty sure that the game will not treat me well for telling Sayori (by implication) that I don't love her just after she's told me about her depression, but telling her I love her would be a lie, and I know that's really not the right way to support depressed people in reality. I hope a game that's getting this much critical praise would be above encouraging that sort of thing, but I'm not that confident.

01:30 Goddamn it. I should just pick one way or another.

01:45 Fine. Ultimately I'm not responsible for Sayori's actions; I have to live my own life, it's not like I can make myself love her. I tell her no.

01:50 Sayori hangs herself. Sux.

Ok, that's a bit flippant. But I'd been thinking through this choice for long enough that I'd at least seriously considered this possibility, and decided that ultimately the responsibility for her choices and actions lies with her. Again, I'm not going to lie to her, and ultimately I-the-player just haven't formed that attachment to her-the-character; this isn't the first videogame death I've seen, not by a long shot, and
