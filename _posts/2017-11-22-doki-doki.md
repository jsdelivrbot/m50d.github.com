title: Why did you make me hit you? (Doki Doki Literature Club)
---
(Spoilers ahead)

00:00 The game asked my name, but everyone keeps talking to me as if I'm male. I mentally rewrite the pronouns they use in my head so that I can imagine I'm a girl. I do the same thing in the game.

00:30 Ok, the poem-writing mechanic is an interesting semi-choice mechanism, and surprisingly fun - it actually captures the feeling of writing a poem while being much easier, which is what games should do. I'm kinda-sorta aiming for Sayori's route, but I end up leaning more towards Natsuki, partly because I agree with her philosophy of literature (while I would certainly say there's value metaphor and applicability, I think the first duty of a work is to be effective on the surface level; I detest obscurantism), and partly because she likes the things I-the-player like. Cool.
