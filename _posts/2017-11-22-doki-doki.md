title: Why did you make me hit you? (Doki Doki Literature Club)
---
(My experience with Doki Doki Literature Club; spoilers ahead)

00:00 The game asked my name, but everyone keeps talking to me as if I'm male. I mentally rewrite the pronouns they use in my head so that I can imagine I'm a girl. I do the same thing in the game.

00:30 Ok, the poem-writing mechanic is an interesting semi-choice mechanism, and surprisingly fun - it actually captures the feeling of writing a poem while being much easier, which is what games should do. I'm kinda-sorta aiming for Sayori's route, but I end up leaning more towards Natsuki, partly because I agree with her philosophy of literature (while I would certainly say there's value metaphor and applicability, I think the first duty of a work is to be effective on the surface level; I detest obscurantism), and partly because she likes the things I-the-player like. Cool.

00:45 Monika tells me I should save before important decisions, as if I've never played a game before.

01:00 The other shoe in starting to drop: I'm getting increasingly unsubtle hints about problems in Natsuki's home life, and then the game tells me directly that Sayori has depression; I haven't seen much of Yuri or Monika but I assume the same will hold for them. Guess this must be the dark side I've been hearing  this game has; I went in without outright spoilers as such, but with an awareness that there was something to be spoiled.

While it's good to see this stuff getting coverage, in a game this short I'm not sure the characters are established enough to carry it; they're dangerously close to being defined entirely by their problems. This then creates a bit of a gap between what I'm supposed to feel and what I do feel. In-game Sayori is a life-long friend who I care deeply about; out-of-game I met her an hour ago and while she's been perfectly pleasant there's very little substance to our relationship.
