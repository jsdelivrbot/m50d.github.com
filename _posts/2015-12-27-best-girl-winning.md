Episode 13 is traditionally a climax of some sort, and this doesn't disappoint. The main event is a full-on set-piece fleet battle, Earth forces struggling desperately to cover the Archangel against an assault from all four captured suits. Power-level-wise it's somewhat questionable - wasn't the Archangel alone holding off these same foes until recently, and won't it do so again shortly? - but visually it's a wonderful spectacle: the full fleet pouring out streams of tracers, hopelessly outclassed by the suits.
