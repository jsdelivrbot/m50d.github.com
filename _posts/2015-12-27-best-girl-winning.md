Episode 13 is traditionally a climax of some sort, and this doesn't disappoint. The main event is a full-on set-piece fleet battle, Earth forces struggling desperately to cover the Archangel against an assault from all four captured suits. Power-level-wise it's somewhat questionable - wasn't the Archangel alone holding off these same foes until recently, and won't it do so again shortly? - but visually it's a wonderful spectacle: the full fleet pouring out streams of tracers, hopelessly outclassed by the suits.

There's slight disappointment in the descent physics with the engines firing the wrong way (can you tell I've been playing Kerbal Space Program?). More serious are the military matters, but I'm honestly not sure what to think here - Badriguel is evidently guilty of gross insubordination (again), but Ramius must realize that her treatment of Kira has been far out of line.
