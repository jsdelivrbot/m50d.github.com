Goodnight, sweet prince. I fear we shall not see her like again.

Yet another transition episode, but it held my attention - it feels like action is genuinely imminent this time. We haven't actually *seen* much of Alaska, but all series it's been built up as a safe haven, the end of Archangel's journey; for Zaft to attack it like this has a real weight to it. Likewise Kira's decision to return to combat feels hefty simply by dint of his having taken several episodes to reach that point.

With Badriguel gone - the visual of the hatch closing over her face is a powerful one - Ramius is forced to be the harsh voice of military authority, which is probably for the best in the long run. One of this episode's motifs seemed to be pairs - Athrun and Izak's dynamic has its similarities with Ramius/Badriguel, and we get another great visual as they say their goodbyes in their bold red uniforms against a sunset that washes out everything else.

Izak is too tsundere to say what he feels directly, but as he and Athrun walk in opposite directions he manages to make himself understood. I wonder if there's a subtle point here about the wisdom of sending teenagers into battle - these two's arguments and insubordination have compromised their effectiveness, whereas Ramius and Badriguel disagree just as much but have the experience to work through their conflicts more effectively.

Le Cruset and La Flaga are a more directly opposite kind of pair, and still seem to have fallen out of another series. I love the ambition of giving them their own backstory, but sadly it never quite works; worlds happening offscreen are expected at the setting level, but the viewer expects to eventually find out about more personal backstory. All I can think is: did I miss an episode? What happened at Endymion, and why can't I remember it?

Flay is the new element this time around. Her and Mu were never on the best of terms, but hopefully he feels enough affinity for her to shake up this confrontation a little. The series makes a rod for its own back with these rival motifs: even if they're perfectly matched, it's hard to believe Rau and Mu haven't found a way to kill each other yet.

And finally, Kira and Lacus. The rousing music and cool Gundam were enough to carry this scene emotionally for the time being, though I can't help noticing that there's very little substance to his plans.
