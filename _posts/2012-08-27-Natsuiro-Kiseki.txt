title: Natsuiro Kiseki
---

Childhood, friendship. A simple life, with simple pleasures. *Natsuiro Kiseki* may not be offering anything new, but it certainly knows how to make me reminisce. Despite its nominally present-day setting, the town, the characters and even the plot seems to belong to a simpler time. While there is a supernatural hook, this is actually just the antics of four (female) friends, much like *Azumanga Daioh* or *Minami-ke*, though with a more serious dramatic thread running through it. As odd as it superficially feels, perhaps the closest comparison is *K-ON!* - particularly since *Natsuiro Kiseki*'s nominal plot is about the girls becoming idols.

But enough about other shows. *Natsuiro Kiseki* has plenty to recommend it; the comedy is warm but amusing, the characters friendly, and the setting captures the atmosphere of a Japanese seaside town perfectly. There's nothing original or life-changing here, but it makes a pleasant "cute girls doing cute things" series. Using supernatural events as hooks for individual episodes (the girls flying, one of them turning invisible, two of them being stuck together...) is perhaps a bit lazy - everything this show does could probably have been done in a realistic setting - but it's lighthearted enough that the magic doesn't feel out of place.
