title: Natsuiro Kiseki
---

Childhood, friendship. A simple life, with simple pleasures. *Natsuiro Kiseki* may not be offering anything new, but it certainly knows how to make me reminisce. Despite its nominally present-day setting, the town, the characters and even the plot seems to belong to a simpler time. While there is a supernatural hook, this is actually just the antics of four (female) friends, much like *Azumanga Daioh* or *Minami-ke*, though with a more serious dramatic thread running through it. As odd as it superficially feels, perhaps the closest comparison is *K-ON!* - particularly since *Natsuiro Kiseki*'s nominal plot is about the girls becoming idols.

But enough about other shows. *Natsuiro Kiseki* has plenty to recommend it; the comedy is warm but amusing, the characters friendly, and the setting captures the atmosphere of a Japanese seaside town perfectly. There's nothing original or life-changing here, but "cute girls doing cute things".
