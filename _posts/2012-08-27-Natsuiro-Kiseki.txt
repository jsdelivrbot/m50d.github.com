title: Natsuiro Kiseki
---

Childhood, friendship. A simple life, with simple pleasures. *Natsuiro Kiseki* may not be offering anything new, but it certainly knows how to make me reminisce. Despite its nominally present-day setting, the town, the characters and even the plot seems to belong to a simpler time. While there is a supernatural hook, this is actually just the antics of four (female) friends, much like *Azumanga Daioh* or *Minami-ke*, though with a more serious dramatic thread running through it. As odd as it superficially feels, perhaps the closest comparison is *K-ON!* - particularly since *Natsuiro Kiseki*'s nominal plot is about the girls becoming idols.

But enough about other shows. *Natsuiro Kiseki* has plenty to recommend it; the comedy is warm but amusing, the characters friendly, and the setting captures the atmosphere of a Japanese seaside town perfectly. There's nothing original or life-changing here, but it makes a pleasant "cute girls doing cute things" series. Using supernatural events as hooks for individual episodes (the girls flying, one of them turning invisible, two of them being stuck together...) is perhaps a bit lazy - everything this show does could probably have been done in a realistic setting - but the tone is lighthearted enough that magic doesn't feel out of place.

At least, it is for the first half. Towards the end this show takes a more dramatic line, centered on one of the girls (Saki) moving away (we're told this from the start, but it gradually gains more prominence). I'm usually a fan of serious content, but in the case of *Natsuiro Kiseki* I feel the show is actually weakened, largely because believable drama demands a realistic or at least internally consistent setting. I'm also uncomfortable with the emphasis placed on remaining friends forever, when we're talking about middle school students moving to be several hours away from each other; realistically, Saki would be better off moving on and making new friends than trying to stay one of the gang with the other three.
