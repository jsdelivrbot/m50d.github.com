In which Kira joins up.

I liked this episode; it's a great exploration of the effects of war even after one is safely out of combat. And the central device is more plausible than you might think; civilian pilots on "the hump" sometimes had their military status fiddled so that they could carry weapons without becoming francs-tireurs, and retroactive redesignations were not unheard of.
