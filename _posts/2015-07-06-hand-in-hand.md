A return to form for *Gundam Seed*'s first real climax, and a taste of things to come. Kira and Athrun find some common ground and some differences, resolving Kira's concerns about fighting once and for all (ish). Rau answers dishonour with treachery, balancing the books. Flay cries and shouts, but like the best of villains she fundamentally has a point: Kira did promise her things would be ok, something that was grossly outside his powers.
