title: Teetering on the Brink (Kokoro Connect episode 8)
---

Four episodes ago I said Kokoro Connect was walking a tightrope with aplomb. For the last three that's remained true. This time I'm not so sure. The characters are still believable teenagers, their emotions still tender and fascinating to watch. The tragedy of their situation remains undeniable. But the hand of the author rests heavily on the tiller, and something's starting to crack.

Yui (#3 female) has pretty much opted out, not appearing in this episode at all. (Female lead) Inaba is also staying as far away from the action as possible. So it's left to (#2 female) Iori and the two gents (Taichi, the lead, and Aoki) to carry the episode, with a bit of help from a background girl whose only characterization before this has been her lusting over Iori. And none of them's really up to the job.

Taichi's character - self-sacrificing, masochistic even - only really works with someone to play off against. Aoki gamely engages him in shouting matches, but he doesn't know how to hurt Taichi the way Inaba can, and the two of them wind up looking more similar than different. Without Yui around, Aoki's own character is weaker than ever; aside from fighting Taichi he did very little this episode. Inaba's continuing desire to isolate herself puts her at odds with Iori, and the resolution that will put the two of them at close quarters with Taichi (and the aforementioned background character) felt rather forced.
