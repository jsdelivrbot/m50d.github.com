title: Becoming More Functional
---
People on [/r/scala](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/) sometimes ask how to make their Scala more functional, or about what "advanced" techniques they should learn. This is a list aimed at people who already follow the [twitter Scala style guide](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/), and want to know where to go from there. I'll assume [ScalaZ](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) is in scope (because I can't find the scaladocs for Cats); [learning ScalaZ](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/7.0/) may be a useful reference for some things.

# Use types to represent data, avoid branching

Types help you keep track of distinctions in your code - if a value has two different states, make them two different types. e.g. a few months ago I had a bug where I passed a graph to a function that expected that graph to have been filtered by another function first. Solution: make the filtered graph and the unfiltered graph different types.

 * `if`/`else` is generally a sign that you want an "ADT" (`sealed trait`). So is a datastructure full of `Option`s or `Either`s, especially if the state of one field affects that of another (e.g. "if `a` is `Some` then `b` is `Left`")
 * `match` constructs are [easy to write unsafely](http://typelevel.org/blog/2014/11/10/why_is_adt_pattern_matching_allowed.html#a-selector-subtlety) and can often be replaced with `fold` (e.g. never `match` an `Option` or an `Either` (unless you need to for `@tailrec`))
  * It might be worth defining your own `fold` methods on any custom `sealed trait`s.
 * Use shapeless-based typeclass derivation to avoid having to write boilerplate for custom datatypes
  * Particularly applicable to "walk the object graph"-like problems e.g. JSON serialization.
  * This is much safer than reflection (and higher-performance too) since it happens at compile time rather than run time, and can give you an error if you try to e.g. include a `File` in your JSON output.
 * Tentative: Use [matryoshka](https://github.com/slamdata/matryoshka) to avoid boilerplate for custom tree-like datatypes where you want to enable traversal.

# Replace general `foldLeft` and friends with more specific operations

`foldLeft` is [a very general/powerful method which makes it hard to reason about](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStylePrincipleofLeastPower.html) - it's more or less as powerful as a general imperative `for` loop - though at least it reduces the scope of the "variables" and makes it explicit exactly what is being threaded through each iteration. So while one of the first steps in making a codebase more functional is replacing looping constructs with `foldLeft` calls, a next step is often to replace that with a more specific/constrained construct:

 * Sometimes there is simply a method for your case e.g. `find`, `forall` `exists`, `groupBy`, `min`, `max` and `partition`. ScalaZ `separate` also sees some use.
 * `reduce` should often be `suml` - you may need to define a `Monoid` instance for your type, or use [shapeless-scalaz](https://github.com/typelevel/shapeless-contrib) to derive one
 * `map` followed by `suml` is `foldMap`
 * `foldLeft` where the body includes a `flatMap` should usually be `traverse` (or `sequence`). This can sometimes be simplified further:
  * `traverse` followed by `map(_.suml)` is `foldMapM`
  * `traverse` followed by `map(_.flatten)` is `traverseM`
 * If a `foldLeft` accumulates or modifies a "secondary" parameter along with its primary operation, often the clearest way to express this is using `Writer` or `State` (see the next section). In which case you can then often rewrite the `foldLeft` as a `traverse` as above.
 
# Use standard `for`/`yield`-enabled types for "secondary" parameters and concerns

Often code has to manage a secondary concern as well as the primary thing it does. Often these are application-wide "cross-cutting concerns", e.g. audit logging, database transaction management, async I/O, or error handling - we can think of these as "effects". There is a tension between making these things explicit enough that the reader understands what the code is "actually" doing (and isn't [confused by "magic"](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/211) or subtle differences in the handling of different effects as in AOP approaches), and ensuring that the "happy path" and primary concern of the code remains clear (a difficulty in "handle errors where they happen" approaches).

Scala's `for`/`yield` offers a useful "third way": one can write a chain of `for { a <- f(); b = g(); c <- h() } yield ...` where the reader can clearly see where the secondary concerns are happening (the `<-` calls) but they don't obscure the straight-through control flow (and the function can remain single-entry/single-exit). We can shift seamlessly between the "value perspective" (where the full effectful value is an ordinary value that we can reason about like any other value, and if necessary compose "manually" with `flatMap` - remember that `for`/`yield` is just a different syntax for `flatMap` chains) and the "happy path perspective" (where we write our code in "straight through style" and trust (in a compiler-verified way) that the secondary effects will be handled somewhere) as appropriate for a given piece of code.

Better still, there are well-known libraries of these types that have already been written, covering many of the common cases and making it easy for your colleagues to know exactly what any given effectful value represents. There are also library functions for managing effects. E.g. to sequence effectful operations on collections, use operations like `traverse` mentioned in the previous section. If you've defined a treelike datatype using matyroshka, the standard traversal operations on it will come with in "monadic" versions that work like `traverse` (i.e. they will perform the traversal using `flatMap` to compose the effects at each stage). Note that these library functions are also usable for any custom effects that conform to the standard interfaces.

 * Code that produces a value and accumulate a secondary value (often a list) should be represented as ScalaZ `Writer`
  * This is particularly useful for structured logging, possibly with the [treelog](https://github.com/lancewalton/treelog) library
 * If you want to thread a secondary value through a series of function calls that also need to change that secondary value, use ScalaZ `State`
 * For validation-like code:
  * Want fail-fast? Use `Either` (or in pre-2.12 Scala, ScalaZ `\/` or Cats `Xor`)
   * If you need to integrate with a library that uses exceptions for failures, you can convert these into `Either` values using the constructs in `scala.util.control.Exception._`:
    * `catching(classOf[SomeSpecificException]) either someLibraryMethod` (returns `Either[SomeSpecificException, ...]`)
    * `nonFatalCatch either someLibraryMethod` (catches all the exceptions that are sensible to retry - everything except fatal system errors)
    * `catching(classOf[SomeSpecificException]) opt someLibraryMethod` (returns `Option[...]`)
  * Want to accumulate all failures? Use ScalaZ `Validation` and accept that you won't be able to use `for`/`yield`
   * `for`/`yield` can't accumulate all errors, because later validations are allowed to depend on the results of earlier ones, but if an earlier validation fails there's no input value for the later validation.
   * Look at applicative chaining (using `*>`) or "applicative builder syntax" (using `|@|`/`âŠ›`) instead.
  * Want to accumulate failures but still return a result value even if there are failures? Use ScalaZ `Writer`
   * `Writer` *can* use `for`/`yield` and accumulate all failures, because earlier validations always return a value even when there's a failure.
 * Need to pass a read-only "context" value down through your business-logic layers even though it's only going to be used at low level? ScalaZ `Reader` might be appropriate.
  * This can be used as a replacement for global constants / `object`s / singletons or even as a form of dependency injection, but beware of overusing it. If an `object` contains no business logic I would leave it as a "global static" `object`, and only move towards a `Reader` style if you actually need to pass different values on occasion (e.g. test stubs).
  * IMO conventional dependency injection can be a relatively benign form of "magic" provided you:
   * Use constructor injection (rather than field injection), so that object constructors and fields still behave as expected. In Scala this is if anything more concise, and it ensures that objects can still easily be constructed "normally" e.g. for unit testing.
   * If there is the possibility of tooling (e.g. "find references") not knowing about the DI mechanism, ensure that there is some visible marker on classes that are constructed through DI so that a reader can immediately see this class is instantiated in a non-standard way.
   * Spring example: `@Component class MyService @Autowired (someDependency: SomeDependency)`
   * For a "green field" project, [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire) is a good pure-Scala option.
  * That said, manual object construction is lightweight enough in Scala that I generally prefer to do my DI "by hand".
  * I appreciate the theoretical elegance of the "cake pattern", but I find it's too much (code-level) overhead to use in practice.
 * Have a piece of effectful code that you can't or won't model in detail, but still want to be able to pass around as a value (i.e. control when the effects happen)? Use ScalaZ `Task`.
 * Want to do async I/O? Use ScalaZ `Task`.
  * You can also use (standard library) `Future`, but beware that it *doesn't* control when the effects happen
   * `Future`s with effects inside them aren't generally values you can pass around and control when they actually happen - rather the effects (e.g. a web request) start immediately when the `Future` is instantiated
   * `Future` would make sense for pure computations. But async in general probably has more overhead than it's worth for cases where you're [working simultaneously rather than waiting simultaneously](http://yosefk.com/blog/working-simultaneously-vs-waiting-simultaneously.html) - where async shines is things like external web requests - and in those cases you usually want to control when the I/O happens.
 * Have operations that need to happen in some kind of "block" or "context"? (e.g. a database transaction) Represent the operations as a value that you pass into a single method that does the open/close, so that you can't have a path where you forget to match them up.
  * This is often a good replacement for "magic" proxies/interceptors (based on method annotations, XML pointcuts or similar)
  * At its simplest the value could just be a function (or a `Task` created using `Task.delay`)
   * In that case you have to be careful not to allow the context to escape (e.g. a file handle that will be closed at the end of the block)
    * Tentative: there is a [theoretical technique for avoiding this](https://apocalisp.wordpress.com/2010/07/02/higher-rank-polymorphism-in-scala/), but I don't think there's a practical library for it yet.
  * If you want a more declarative/introspectable/testable way to express your commands, define a custom ADT (`sealed trait`).
  * If you need to compose The free monad can give you a more lightweight way to represent your commands

  * double-`flatMap` (`flatMap { _.flatMap {... }}` or `flatMap { _.map { ... } }`) is sometimes a sign you should be using a monad transformer. Alternatively, if you're struggling to combine stacks of effects and nest `flatMap`s correctly, consider using a free coproduct approach instead.
 * `map(_.map(...))` (or similarly with flatMap) probably indicates you should be using a monad transformer
 * if a parameter is passed down untouched through several layers of function calls it might be better for those functions to return Reader
 * if you pass a "secondary" parameter in and out (by returning tuples) of a series of functions it might be better for those functions to return State
 * if a bunch of functions have "secondary" return values that are merged to be the "secondary" return value of their parent it might be better for them to return Writer
 * if you're foldLefting with a secondary state value that functions like any of the above types that's probably better expressed as foldMapA
 * anything that pattern matches on a sealed trait can be expressed as fold
 * if you do this and end up with `identity` or `{}` anywhere there might well be a more specialized method (e.g. `option.fold(...)(identity)` is just `option.getOrElse(...)`)
 * if you have a custom recursive data structure (e.g. a specialized tree) and traverse it in a way that ends up as a lot of nested flatmap calls it might be better to express the data structure as a fixed point and then use a standard traversal on it (recursion-schemes style). There's a lot of code overhead to using those techniques in Scala though, so it's probably not worth doing for a simple catamorphism etc.
 * if you have some construct that needs to only be "executed" in a particular context (i.e. certain things need to happen before and after) consider introducing a monad
 * if you have a sealed set of "commands" but also want to allow arbitrary pure functions that should be part of the same "execution", consider a free monad
 * if you're stacking a lot of "unrelated" monads maybe you want a free coproduct (kind of an open "research" area in Scala as in there are a bunch of libraries being written in search of the right way to do this - freek sounds promising)
 
 # Things to not bother with
 
 * Don't bother with sbt - use maven (until you need to cross-build libraries)
 * Don't bother with scalatest, or any fancy "tests in plain english" library - use plain junit
 * Don't use the cake pattern or reader monad. If you're using Spring or similar, keep using it for now - just make sure you use constructor injection rather than field injection.
 * Do make sure that you complete migrations of components, and have a clear border between Scala and Java. Jumping back and forth repeatedly in the same project seems fine to start with, but brings trouble in the long run
 * At the very start, keep all your existing libraries - once you have a component that's solidly on Scala you can start looking for better replacements for libraries that component uses.
 * The most useful libraries to change are anything you're currently using annotations for - you'll see an immediate return by removing the amount of "magic" in your codebase. Web backends and database access are good candidates.
 * Spark is great but only if you have so much data that you can't use anything else.
 * IMO there are no good web UI libraries for Scala - I stick to Wicket. There are excellent web API libraries though - my favourite is Spray.
 * I wouldn't use play, akka actors (except as an implementation detail that you never directly touch), or anything that uses typesafe-config if you can help it. These libraries have very poor typesafety which destroys the main advantage of using Scala. More generally any library designed to be used from Java is probably not worth bothering with.
 * If you think you want Actors you probably just want Futures.
 * `case class`es and type inference are common-sense and you can use them basically immediately.
 * pattern matching and multiple inheritance promote bad habits and may be worth just avoiding entirely.
 * fancier functions/types found in cats/scalaz need care. I wouldn't say ban them; I would say require code review (and maybe an explicit example of what the code would look like without that function/type) for each new concept so that you're only introducing new constructs where they pay their way.
 * This is doubly true of streaming libraries or anything else very advanced. They're very much worthwhile where needed, but make sure you're justifying them rather than cargo-culting.
