title: Magic and Progress (Chūnibyō Demo Koi ga Shitai!)
---

I finished *Chūnibyō* over Christmas, and I hope I won't offend too many people by saying it felt particularly relevant as an ex-LARPer. I've also just finished reading *Supergods*, and it could have been written about this series - or even by one of the *Chūnibyō* characters.

Humanity is the storytelling ape; distinguished from our relatives more than anything else by our ability to connect events into narratives - or form new ones out of whole cloth.
