Sometimes it's about knowing when to relax.

What I loved about this episode was how it subtly showed how dangerous Coordinators are. Cagalli has Athrun at gunpoint more than once, but it's never more than a minor inconvenience: he can't quite dodge bullets, but he can move so fast as to be close enough. He's so disdainful of Cagalli's baseline humanity (and her femininity) that he not only lets her live but frees her to wander. Their final face-off is almost a punchline: the weapons are reversed, but it's Cagalli who's brought a knife to a gun fight.

It's a good episode on the surface level too. Recapitulating the essential plot in miniature is a well-worn technique, but for good reason: watching Cagalli and Athrun replay the roles of their wider societies highlights the essence of *Gundam Seed*'s tragedy - and of their respective personalities.
