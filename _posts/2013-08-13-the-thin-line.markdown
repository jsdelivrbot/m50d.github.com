title: "The Thin Line (Psycho-Pass)"

The '60s *Batman* TV series was created by two people - one who loved comics, one who
passionately hated them. I'm starting to wonder if this isn't the best way to make things.

*Psycho-Pass* is that rarest of shows: a fundamentally political series that manages to leave both sides open.

I loved *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex*, but the politics is undeniably offputting.
