title: "The Thin Line (Psycho-Pass)"
---

The '60s *Batman* TV series was created by two people - one who loved comics, one who
passionately hated them. I'm starting to wonder if this isn't the best way to make things.

*Psycho-Pass* is that rarest of shows: a fundamentally political series that manages to leave both sides open. Like *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* (which it clearly owes a lot to), it tells the story of a militarized police unit whose opponents are dedicated terrorists, the kind of people who think nothing of civilian casualties. We see murders, a rape attempt, and a particularly brutal piece of mutilation.

But we also see the downsides of life under enlightened totalitarianism. We see the people who feel like they have no hope, who were judged at birth (or at least in their early years) to be dangers to society with no chance of redemption. We see how crushing even a small amount of time in prison can be, because time spent in prison only makes you less fit to rejoin society - something that's likely true in the real world, but the idea of a machine that can put a number on it makes the damage much more visceral. We see those who have no choices but try and get along as best as they can - and those who have plenty of choices but feel trapped even so. We see the bullying that must be endemic to a system where everyone's numerical value is publicly displayed.
