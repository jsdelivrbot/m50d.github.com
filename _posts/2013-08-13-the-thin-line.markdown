title: "The Thin Line (Psycho-Pass)"
---

The '60s *Batman* TV series was created by two people - one who loved comics, one who
passionately hated them. I'm starting to wonder if this isn't the best way to make things.

*Psycho-Pass* is that rarest of shows: a fundamentally political series that manages to leave both sides open. Like *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* (which it clearly owes a lot to), it tells the story of a militarized police unit whose opponents are dedicated terrorists, the kind of people who think nothing of civilian casualties. We see murders, a rape attempt, and a particularly brutal piece of mutilation.

But we also see the downsides of life under enlightened totalitarianism. We see the people who feel like they have no hope, who were judged at birth (or at least in their early years) to be dangers to society with no chance of redemption. We see how crushing even a small amount of time in prison can be, because time spent in prison only makes you less fit to rejoin society - something that's likely true in the real world, but the idea of a machine that can put a number on it makes the damage much more visceral. We see those who have no choices but try and get along as best as they can - and those who have plenty of choices but feel trapped even so. We see the bullying that must be endemic to a system where everyone's numerical value is publicly displayed. It's like those two episodes of *Guilty Crown* where Shuu became a dictator.

And yet, it doesn't feel unwarranted. Not necessarily because of the evils of the terrorists opposing the system - every cause has its extremists - but because life in this brave new world is, on the whole, genuinely good. Crime has fallen to the extent that three small squads seem to be covering all of Tokyo, or possibly even Japan. Some characters feel trapped by the system, but just as many are releived to find that society has a place for them, a role for them to play. Newspapers often rail against the "nanny state", but *Psycho-Pass* shows us what one might look like in practice, and it's not an alltogether bad deal.
