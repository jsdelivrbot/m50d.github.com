I watched *The Auteur* recently, and was surprised how implausible I found the concept - a serious, artistic director, firmly devoted to his vision, making porn. Well, maybe that's not so plausible - the defining characteristic of porn is that it panders to the viewer, offering exactly what they want with minimal effort.
