I watched *The Auteur* recently, and was surprised how implausible I found the concept - a serious, artistic director, firmly devoted to his vision, making porn. Well, maybe that's not so plausible - the defining characteristic of porn is that it panders to the viewer, offering exactly what they want with minimal effort. But eroticism seems like a powerful (if crude) tool, something artists would do very well to have in their palette.

We see a few instances of this; the British Museum's current "Shunga" exhibition is well regarded, erotic but commanding aesthetic respect. But this seems to be fundamentally a matter of orientalism; it's impossible to imagine a similar exhibition accomodating, say, the works of Luis Royo. In the west there is this sharp line between serious artistic endeavour and anything with the potential to titilate. (I recall an introduction to *Lolita* which was at pains to point out that, although originally published as porn, the novel in fact had its scenes carefully arranged to frustrate such tastes). Of late I've been reading some really quite excellent stories produced by a small internet circle. They're not copyright-breaking fanfiction, and there's a lot of genuine artistic talent on display. But because their style runs to erotica, none of the members seem to think about even trying to do anything with their stories except give them away on the internet.

Interestingly this does not seem to be the case in Japan; witness e.g. "Takotsuboya", the frustrated aspiring manga artist who turned to pornographic fanfiction (the open sale of which is entirely accepted in Japan).
