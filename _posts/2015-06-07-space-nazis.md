A hard episode to watch, particularly given what I wrote about Flay last time. I had hoped to see her more fully characterized, rehabilitated even, before her final turn to evil. But instead it seems the show is determined to paint her that way from the start. It's a curious decision, and one seemingly at odds with the wider narrative that *SEED* is trying to push: that people are fundamentally good, and need only to understand each other.
