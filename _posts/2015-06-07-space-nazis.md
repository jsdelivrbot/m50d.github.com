A hard episode to watch, particularly given what I wrote about Flay last time. I had hoped to see her more fully characterized, rehabilitated even, before her final turn to evil. But instead it seems the show is determined to paint her that way from the start. It's a curious decision, and one seemingly at odds with the wider narrative that *SEED* is trying to push: that people are fundamentally good, and need only to understand each other.

Or maybe that's not the message at all. The brief cut to Mu near the end - while elegantly developing him a little more - served to emphasise that, perhaps, evil can be found on both sides of this conflict, and bad people do exist - just not in the place you'd expect to find them. AIUI Gundam's racism traditionally lies in the coordinator-like faction, so Blue Cosmos - who I'm sure we'll meet again - is a new side on that story.

I still don't know if Haro is another Gundam tradition - it's not something I've seen in another show - but it's remarkably out of place in this one, and adds an extra layer of irritation to what's already an annoyingly perfect character (at least in theory - I happen to quite like Lacus myself).
