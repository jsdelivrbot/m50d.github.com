> It's pointless to speak of any "meaning". If we cared to look, we might find a meaning, but even if we did, those girls would not have chosen it for themselves.

Wow. Three days after finishing *Simoun*, I'm still at a loss to describe its beauty. I don't think I've seen such an unmistakable work of art since *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*. Ironic that the only recommendation I've had was "Haha, it's about aeroplanes powered by teenage lesbianism".

Of course there is some truth to this, but I found the early kisses more disturbing than fanservicey. Perhaps a viewer new to anime would dismiss (as mere excuse) the setting/premise, exposited a little clunkily over the first couple of episodes, of a world in which children grow up sexless, choosing gender only when they are of age. But with some anime experience it's striking just how much our characters' looks and speech patterns straddle the line between male and female. Liberal as I am, many of them seemed outright *wrong*, as alien as a race with extra fingers.

In-universe, it becomes gradually clear that the Simile are a band apart; what starts as admiration and respect from the populace becomes adoration as the war worsens and people cling more closely to their faith. We see a very human mix of responses to this; Neviril, the prima donna, rises to the occasion, her aloofness becoming the nobility the people needed. Conversely, the friendlier Floe's desire to be treated normally gets her nothing but trouble. But as the people's need for the Simile to remain pure and untouched becomes stronger forever, so does the military's need for them to fight.

This is the real conflict driving *Simoun*, and it's surprisingly positive for a show about war: everyone, even enemy soldiers and the hated defense minister, seems to be genuinely trying to do their best for their country.
