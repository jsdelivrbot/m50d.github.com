> It's pointless to speak of any "meaning". If we cared to look, we might find a meaning, but even if we did, those girls would not have chosen it for themselves.

Wow. Three days after finishing *Simoun*, I'm still at a loss to describe its beauty. I don't think I've seen such an unmistakable work of art since *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*. Ironic that the only recommendation I've had was "Haha, it's about aeroplanes powered by teenage lesbianism".

Of course there is some truth to this, but I found the early kisses more disturbing than fanservicey. Perhaps a viewer new to anime would dismiss (as mere excuse) the setting/premise, exposited a little clunkily over the first couple of episodes, of a world in which children grow up sexless, choosing gender only when they are of age. But with some anime experience it's striking just how much our characters' looks and speech patterns straddle the line between male and female. Liberal as I am, many of them seemed outright *wrong*, as alien as a race with extra fingers.
