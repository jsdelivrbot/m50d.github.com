title: Give Me a Real Programming Language
---

The modern programming language is a complex and beautiful thing. Decades of research have gone into making it, and great accolades await anyone who can make even the slightest of improvements. The idea of "visual programming", expressing programs not as simple text files but some kind of rich, graphical, colourful view (usually based on some kind of "flowchart"), has been a perennial favourite, fruit for numerous PhD theses. Of course, each year no more than a handful of new languages gain any kind of traction, and not one visual programming language has ever been widely adopted.

So why do so many companies seem to think they can do better? All too often a system requires a turing-complete configuration, but we users are made to express it in some custom, tool-specific language - or worse, by dragging and dropping in some GUI.
