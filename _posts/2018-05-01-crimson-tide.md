No-one is as awesome as you, Flay.

Much of this episode felt like a mix of marking time and recap, which I guess makes sense for a tribunal. (Perhaps luckily, it comes just when I'd taken a bit of a break from this project, so the recap is no bad thing). The clash between Badriguel and Ramius' command styles seems like it should come to a head, with Ramius outright admitting that she is (by her own standards) unfit for command - unfortunately this is one of those episodes that's robbed of its tension by my having seen the series before.

I'm genuinely unsure what a realistic outcome looks like here. Ramius has overseen a series of shocking breakdowns in military discipline, mistreatment of a prisoner (a genuine war crime) being only the most recent and most obviously avoidable example. At the same time, her ship has won repeatedly against impossible odds; had Archangel successfully delivered the Strike to Alaska, I suspect that success would have outweighed any failure to follow procedures.
