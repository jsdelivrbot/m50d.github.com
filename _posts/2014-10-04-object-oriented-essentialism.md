Many mathematics students have disproportionate trouble with non-standard analysis. The concepts are not difficult; indeed, they align with many freshmen's naive intuitions about calculus: there's a new kind of number, infinitesimals; any number of infinitesimals will never add up to an ordinary positive number; an infinitesimal squared is doubly infinitesimal, and so on. But paradoxically it's *because* these ideas are so obvious that they're so difficult to accept - to get to this stage, the student has spent months beating them out of himself, in favour of the rigorous Weierstraussian notion of limits of epsilons and deltas. He scoffs at the very notion of infinitesimals - the very idea! - with the righteous zeal of the fresh convert. Small wonder that he has difficulty taking these freshly-crushed ideas seriously.

So too, I think, it is with essentialism - the misguided philosophical notion that a thing's identity is defined by its attributes, that the very concept of identity is meaningful.

Early this year, when asking which scientific idea should be retired, Richard Dawkins, writing in the Guardian, suggested (essentialism)[http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/12/what-scientific-idea-is-ready-for-retirement-edge-org]. It's easy to see why;
