As a liberal rationalist, I feel obliged to respond to [Yummyfajitas' blog post]() claiming that a basic job would be superior to a basic income. Rather than pick holes in his analysis, I think the best approach is to start from scratch, deriving a model from first principles (and my own prejudices), and seeing what results come out.

## Human Behaviour

So: At any given time there are a certain number of jobs available, following an exponential decay curve (or perhaps a power law) in terms of how lucrative and/or productive they are.
