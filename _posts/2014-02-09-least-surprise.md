I've joked before that I judge things by their Kolgomorov complexity. But like everything in life, novelty is best enjoyed in moderation. At least, that's the only explanation I can find for how much I'm enjoying *Sakura Trick*.

I've enjoyed formulaic series before. *Heartcatch Pretty Cure* had maybe 2/3 of episodes hold to the same template (at least until the final arc): character encounters problem with their hobby (cycling, photography, cookery... ) and is turned into a Desertarian. After causing some chaos they are found by the pretty cures and have sense beaten into them, allowing them to work through their issues. Heck, I'm on record as a fan of transformation sequences, and Gundam launch sequences, and even the Tracy Island stock footage - as plain an example of unoriginality as you'll ever see. But those shows use their formula more as frame than content; the characters and their equipment are the backstory, and the stock footage is a visual shorthand for everything that's come before this point. In the Age Of The DVD Box Set it's harder to justify, but for an individual episode considered in isolation it makes a lot of sense - particularly when a show is aimed at younger viewers with less effective memories.

Be that as it may, *Sakura Trick* is not one of those shows. Rather than a formulaic structure (that hopefully brings out the differences between the content of individual episodes), the arc shapes of each episode are actually quite varied - haphazard, even. When *Evangelion* gave distinct titles to each half-episode it seemed like just another piece of arbitrary symbolism (particularly given how little sense those titles made). *Sakura Trick*'s titles are painfully obvious, and bluntly reinforce that this is a compressed adaptation of existing material; the last show I can remember with this structure is *Azumanga Daioh*. The level of continuity is similar too: a series of vignettes that don't directly connect, but with character relationships building up over time, and telling the story of the girls' progression through school. In *Sakura Trick*'s case we get extra cheap (but effective) angst from the fact that the school will close when they finish.

And then there's the kissing. So far every episode has come with a seemingly minute-long scene of leads Haruka and Yuu liplocked and making noises, in a more or less compromising position. On Japanese television, it's probably groundbreaking - this is the show that *Yuru Yuri* (say) wanted, but didn't dare, to be. To an internet viewer, with all manner of hardcore just a directory away, it seems... well, quaint.

That's probably the best adjective for *Sakura Trick* as a whole. It
