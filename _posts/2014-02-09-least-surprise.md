I've joked before that I judge things by their Kolgomorov complexity. But like everything in life, novelty is best enjoyed in moderation. At least, that's the only explanation I can find for how much I'm enjoying *Sakura Trick*.

I've enjoyed formulaic series before. *Heartcatch Pretty Cure* had maybe 2/3 of episodes hold to the same template (at least until the final arc): character encounters problem with their hobby (cycling, photography, cookery... ) and is turned into a Desertarian. After causing some chaos they are found by the pretty cures and have sense beaten into them, allowing them to work through their issues. Heck, I'm on record as a fan of transformation sequences, and Gundam launch sequences, and even the Tracy Island stock footage - as plain an example of unoriginality as you'll ever see. But those shows use their formula more as frame than content; the characters and their equipment are the backstory, and the stock footage is a visual shorthand for everything that's come before this point. In the Age Of The DVD Box Set it's harder to justify, but for an individual episode considered in isolation it makes a lot of sense - particularly when a show is aimed at younger viewers with less effective memories.
