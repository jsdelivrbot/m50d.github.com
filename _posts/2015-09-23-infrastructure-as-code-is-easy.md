A response to [Infrastructure as code might be literally impossible
](http://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2015/09/15/automacon-infrastructure-as-code-might-be-literally-impossible/)

What if I told you:
 * Some languages are perceived as terribly difficult, but are easy.
 * I'm not surprised MRI is buggy. It's written in C.
 * I'm not surprised apt is buggy. It's written in C.
 * You don't have to read every line to understand code if you:
   * Understand the *laws* the code obeys
   * Require [proof](https://gist.github.com/alanpog/3316784)
 * What if I told you: MRI was obsolete before it was written
   * (at least when correctness is more important than time-to-market, which is true approximately never, but that's another talk)
