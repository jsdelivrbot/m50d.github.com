Giles Bowkett has mastered opposition, but he's not yet ready for government. In [this post](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html) he tells us Scrum is "conceptually flawed", "bizarre", "condescending" and at best, a "dog-and-pony show". But his only positive prescription, other than "get better at hiring engineers" (gee, I'd never have thought to try that), is the folksy wisdom that we should "treat these workers as adults and trust them to do their jobs." You don't want to do that, and they don't want to do that either.

The most vital part of job satisfaction is the feeling that one is doing something valuable, something that other people want. For an ivory-tower backend programmer like me who spends a lot of his time changing the monad stack so that other programmers get better error reporting, it's very easy to lose that connection
