Giles Bowkett has mastered opposition, but he's not yet ready for government. In [this post](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/why-scrum-should-basically-just-die-in.html) he tells us Scrum is "conceptually flawed", "bizarre", "condescending" and at best, a "dog-and-pony show". But his only positive prescription, other than "get better at hiring engineers" (gee, I'd never have thought to try that), is the folksy wisdom that we should "treat these workers as adults and trust them to do their jobs." You don't want to do that, and they don't want to do that either. If you tear down Scrum and don't replace it with anything, your developers will write the same code as each other and spend days sorting out the merge. 

The most vital part of job satisfaction is the feeling that one is doing something valuable, something that other people want. For an ivory-tower backend programmer like me who spent today switching our monad stack so that other programmers would get better error messages, you can sometimes feel like a lighthouse keeper in the post-apocalypse, unsure whether the ships you're guarding are even out there any more.

Estimating and planning with stakeholders puts the business value front-and-center - and what the business values can often surprise you. I was once on a team that received a cake from another office expressing their heartfelt gratitude for a two-line change that, had we any idea of the value placed on it, we could have made at any point in the previous six months. They'd assumed it would be months of work, so they never considered it high-priority enough to ask for (we only found out about it at all thanks to a company-wide drinking event, but that's another blog post).
