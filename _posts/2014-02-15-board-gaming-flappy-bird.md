Board gaming needs a *Flappy Bird*.

I've been thinking about board game mechanics since watching [this fascinating talk](http://vimeo.com/82383614) from the creator of Risk Legacy. I applaud Daviai's willingness to experiment with new mechanics, but the legacy design is exactly the opposite of what appeals to me in gaming. Games are almost by definition a circumscribed activity: you fight viciously while the contest is ongoing, but eventually someone wins, someone loses, and you put it back in the box and go back to being friends. Early cultures developed games as a substitute for fighting, and this was probably the key reason: they create a kind of liminal zine in which you can compete with each other while at the same time knowing that it's only a game, your true friendship remains unshaken. Some of the most enduring games even have multiple levels of this: one might play knucklebones for an evening and that's a game. But each toss of the bones is also circumscribed even within the game, so the game's actually a sequence of much smaller games.
