# In the future everyone will be discriminated against for 15 minutes

A few days ago, my boss noticed that Amazon was offering him a much higher price for the same product than us underlings. Yesterday a friend observed that it's possible to reliably estimate someone's political affiliation from publicly available data. If you had Facebook or Google or Amazon's cooperation (and for the record Facebook shares no information on specific individuals, at least that I've seen), it would not be difficult for a store to offer a higher price to republicans, or environmentalists, or people called Dave.

As I understand it, current law makes discrimination against specific kinds of groups illegal. But shopkeepers and the like enjoy the right to treat specific individuals differently, for any reason other than membership of these groups; if you want to refuse service to Bob because he looks scruffy, or slept with your girlfriend, that's your right. US employment law as I understand it is stricter: if some factor is correlated with membership of a protected category, then you may only use this factor in hiring decisions if it is demonstrably related to the specific job you're hiring for.

This was probably a pragmatic option at the time.
