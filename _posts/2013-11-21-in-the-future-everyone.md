# In the future everyone will be discriminated against for 15 minutes

A few days ago, my boss noticed that Amazon was offering him a much higher price for the same product than us underlings. Yesterday a friend observed that it's possible to reliably estimate someone's political affiliation from publicly available data. If you had Facebook or Google or Amazon's cooperation (and for the record Facebook shares no information on specific individuals, at least that I've seen), it would not be difficult for a store to offer a higher price to republicans, or environmentalists, or people called Dave.
