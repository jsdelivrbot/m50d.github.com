title: Scheduling Conflicts
---

My second year of running an anim&eacute; evening is drawing to a close; traditionally this is about the time that such efforts collapse. Only one of the original attendees remains, and what female contingent we had is departing entirely (and if they weren't my proposed schedule for this season would probably push them over the edge). But on the whole the group is stronger than ever, and I look forward to many more years of the highs and lows.

Some seasons are easy.
