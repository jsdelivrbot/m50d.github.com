The characters of *Aku no Hana* (*Flower of Evil*) are in middle school. In fact, since Saeki's PE shirt lists her class as 2-1, it's fair to say they're in the second year of middle school.

It's more than a naming coincidence. *Chuunibyo demo Koi ga Shitai* reminded me of my childhood (and university days) in a way I could laugh at; *Aku no Hana* is crueller but no less accurate. (I hasten to add that I never stole clothes or anything of the sort). School is the greatest concentration of pure evil I've personally encontered; people who  will be perfectly upstanding citizens in later life (and I've met some of them since) act with the cruelty of psychopaths.

For a self-conscious, intelligent student, precocious on some axes and grossly immature on others, it can be hell. You do what you have to to fit in, but feel incredible levels of guilt afterwards, because you're trying to apply ordinary morality to a situation where it simply doesn't or cannot apply.
