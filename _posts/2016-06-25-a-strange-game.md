title: A Strange Game (Gundam Seed 19)

On paper this is a bridging episode - filler even. There are no robot fights, no real plot developments (buying new munitions could easily be done offscreen, or even ignored entirely), and the "villains out shopping" gimmick is implausible at the best of times. Sure, Wartfeld gets a chance to expound on the show's themes - human development and the avoidability of conflict - but he's not saying anything we haven't heard already.

And yet somehow it manages to be utterly compelling. Indeed this is one of the few episodes I remembered clearly from 5+ years ago. Partly it's that the conceit, for all its ridiculousness, feels genuinely tense.

Partly it's the gratuitous fanservice. But mostly, I think, it's the characterization. Wartfeld is this mass of contradictions but somehow consistent about it; at the very least, this particular act fits his personality perfectly. Cagalli is an object in more ways than one - "If you didn't talk, you'd be the perfect woman" is crasser than the way the resistance idolises her, but both are coming from the same place.

I'm currently near the end of *Iron Blooded Orphans* - it's interesting to see how much has changed and how much has stayed the same. *Gundam* has always prided itself on its realism,
