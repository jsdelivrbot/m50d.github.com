I had a similar experience with *Groundhog Day*[2]. Given infinite time, a man goes through all the possible responses - anger, denial, acceptance - and chooses the noble option; he betters himself, both morally (learning to help strangers) and functionally (becoming, if nothing else, a talented ice sculptor).

There is sadness and suffering,
