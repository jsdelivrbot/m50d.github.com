title: "I'm so glad I fell in love with you"

I was recommended *Good Will Hunting* in my final year of university, by a fellow mathematician[1]. (The extent to which she felt I resembled the title character is an open question). It makes an interesting, hopeful point - that those with talents should use them, and even the untalented can recognize when someone's wasting their ability - and then proceeds to undermine it with the ending, where our mathematical genius confronts his fears, departs his worthless job... and goes to chase down a waitress.

I had a similar experience with *Groundhog Day*[2]. Given infinite time, a man goes through all the possible responses - anger, denial, acceptance - and chooses the noble option; he betters himself, both morally (learning to help strangers) and functionally (becoming, if nothing else, a talented ice sculptor). And yet the film tells us that none of this matters: only "true love", it seems, has the power to change fate.

Which is part of why *Honey & Clover* sits very high on my list[3]. Not only is it a beautifully constructed story of human relationships[4],
