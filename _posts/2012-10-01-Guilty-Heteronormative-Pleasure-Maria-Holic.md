This was going to be a post about *Maria Holic*, but in the light of a friend's response to same, the first episode of *Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun*, and [Notch's hastily-edited blog post](http://notch.tumblr.com/post/32726020631/john-callaham-dont-be-a-goat-murderer), it's now a post about rape jokes.

Let me start by declaring my position of privilege. While I have a little more experience of this kind of thing than most guys, I am well aware that these things are different from girls. The position that any kind of rape joke, anywhere, is not acceptable, is not an unreasonable one, and maybe it's the only one that can work. Society has managed to survive the loss (largely) of racist jokes, even the joke form itself is in decline; I'm sure we can find other ways to entertain each other.

I've only been threatened with rape once, and it was the single most unpleasant experience of my life. (Which, yes, means I've lived a pretty sheltered life) But I took no offense when seeing such a threat used in *Maria Holic*,
