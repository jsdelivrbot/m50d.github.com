This was going to be a post about *Maria Holic*, but in the light of a friend's response to same, the first episode of *Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun*, and [Notch's hastily-edited blog post](http://notch.tumblr.com/post/32726020631/john-callaham-dont-be-a-goat-murderer), it's now a post about rape jokes.

Let me start by declaring my position of privilege. While I have a little more experience of this kind of thing than most guys, I am well aware that these things are different from girls. The position that any kind of rape joke, anywhere, is not acceptable, is not an unreasonable one, and maybe it's the only one that can work. Society has managed to survive the loss (largely) of racist jokes, even the joke form itself is in decline; I'm sure we can find other ways to entertain each other.

I've only been threatened with rape once, and it was the single most unpleasant experience of my life. (Which, yes, means I've lived a pretty sheltered life) But I took no offense - indeed, I barely even noticed the line - when seeing such a threat used in *Maria Holic*, and was quite surprised to hear my friend make an issue of it. I can make up explanations for it - the line fitted naturally into the scene, neither threatener nor threatened is a particularly sympathetic character, and the line loses much of its power from being delivered by an apparent girl. (The more I thought about this, the more unfortunately heteronormative it seems; despite all logic I see Kanako as taking a male role in her relationship with Maria)
