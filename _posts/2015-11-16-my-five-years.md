title: My Five Years of Scala
---

My own 5.5 years of Scala have been rather different from [those described here](http://manuel.bernhardt.io/2015/11/13/5-years-of-scala-and-counting-debunking-some-myths-about-the-language-and-its-environment/). Rather than saying that one or other of us is wrong, take this as a sign that Scala is a broad church, as any general-purpose programming language ultimately must be.
