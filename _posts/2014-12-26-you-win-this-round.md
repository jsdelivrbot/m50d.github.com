I suppose I deserve what I get, trying to criticize *Gundam Seed* for things it hasn't done - and, it turns out, won't do. Kira's acceptance of the pilot seat is more fraught than I remembered; "you people aren't fair", he cries, a charge that applies to the writers just as much as to the Earth Forces. That does Kira do?there is only one mobile suit available is, if anything, even less plausible than that there would only be one coordinator available to fly it. And yet, for those of us willing to suspend disbelief, here we are. So: what would you do?

In this light, Kira's decision to fight seems a little more plausible - and the fact that he kills, downplayed as it is, gives him reason to become a soldier, because what would he be now if he tried to give it up? That he would kill Athrun's colleagues but stand moodily before the man himself is... awkward, but perhaps not entirely implausible, particularly as both are teenagers.

The absence of any good choices is underscored elegantly by a few lines of bridge conversation; Ramius wants to avoid damaging the colony, but that's simply not a practical option when they're fighting inside it. As always, the show is eloquent and forceful in its portrayal of the consequences, as the habitat falls inevitably from damaged to shattered. The series tries to put a face on the citizens whose home has just been destroyed, but unfortunately it's that of Cagalli, who we (for the moment) have very little reason to care about; indeed we don't even know her name (or sex).

Kira's student friends (still) have a similar problem; we have names and a few hints about who's involved with who, but not enough to hang a character off. A longer series like this one can afford to take its time, rotating characters in and out of the main cast, but *Gundam Seed* knows these are perpetual third-stringers, and treats them accordingly; it might have done better to give Kira one or two more fully-developed friends.
