I suppose I deserve what I get, trying to criticize *Gundam Seed* for things it hasn't done - and, it turns out, won't do. Kira's acceptance of the pilot seat is more fraught than I remembered; "you people aren't fair", he cries, a charge that applies to the writers just as much as to the Earth Forces. That there is only one mobile suit available is, if anything, even less plausible than that there would only be one coordinator available to fly it.
