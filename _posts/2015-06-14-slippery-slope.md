A much more enjoyable episode. Either *Gundam Seed* has found its feet, or it does combat much better than it does plot. Sadly I fear it's the latter.

We get our brief moment of peace and respite over the first half, but this episode is mostly fight, and a curiously one-sided fight at that; given that Strike will shortly be taking on four suits single-handledly, it's odd that it and three Earth ships are powerless against Aegis and a handful of GINNs. Maybe this is meant to be the story of the whole war - that Earth's numbers are nothing against Coordinator superiority - but in context it feels forced; Flay's father has to die because the plot demands it, so the squadron carrying him is wiped out.

Of course, the fight isn't just between spaceships and robots; even as a powerless civilian, Flay creatively finds a way to involve herself directly, which is then taken up by Natarle.
