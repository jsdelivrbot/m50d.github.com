Seen as a fight show, *Gundam Seed*'s original sin is that it tries to have repeated fights between the same two teams. Not only does this weaken the stakes - how can this week's fight possibly make a difference when they'll be doing the same thing next week? - but it also gives us a powerlevel problem: even if the two sides are initially evenly matched, any small victory should make for an advantage that snowballs.

In this episode the problem is particularly stark, since there are no allied forces on either side to fine-tune the balance of power. At the start of the episode, we're expected to believe that the loss of Nikolai makes the Zala squad's position untenable, the Archangel almost singlehandedly forcing them to retreat even with the Strike severely damaged. And yet at the end of this same episode, those same three mobile suits are supposed to represent a serious threat and even severly damage the Archangel. Unless Tolle was the lynchpin of the Archangel's defenses, it doesn't make any sense.
