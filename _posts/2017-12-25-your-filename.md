Of all the secondary characters in *Gundam Seed*, I wish we saw more of Badriguel. Unlike the milquetoast cadets, she's willing - possibly too willing - to contradict everyone, even the captain. She has her own beliefs - she must have hopes and dreams and fears to explore - but all too often she's cast as the impersonal voice of military discipline. Certainly that was the only way I remembered her from watching the show as a 20-year-old.
