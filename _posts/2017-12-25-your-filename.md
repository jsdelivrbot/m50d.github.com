Of all the secondary characters in *Gundam Seed*, I wish we saw more of Badriguel. Unlike the milquetoast cadets, she's willing - possibly too willing - to contradict everyone, even the captain. She has her own beliefs - she must have hopes and dreams and fears - but all too often she's the impersonal voice of military discipline.
