## The Difference Between Precision and Accuracy

[A year ago](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/basic_income_vs_basic_job.html), Chris Stucchio (AKA yummyfajitas) wrote on the subject of basic income. He wrote some code, ran some monte carlo simulations, and came out with some quite shocking results; a basic job was far, far superior to a basic income. He offered no explanation for this result, beyond the code itself, and wrote stridently that those who disagreed should offer code rather than words.

But a money gap of the size described doesn't appear out of nowhere. To understand what's going on in Stucchio's simulations, we have to do exactly what he doesn't want to: look at the numbers, and think about what they mean, in words. Fortunately, [someone has done the first step of simplification for us](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7452196). Stucchio's original model has a bunch of epicycles that make it look more impressive than it is; the meat is here. And in fact most of the variation comes from a much simpler source:
