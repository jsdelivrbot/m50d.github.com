Despite the combat elements, this is a calmer episode; almost everything is an inevitable consequence of the events of last week, giving us time to relax (and enjoy the - still excellent - musical score). The one pivotal scene was one I'd entirely forgotten - not-yet-Captain Ramius taking her rescuers hostage at gunpoint, insisting that - despite all that's happened - they've seen a military secret and can't be allowed to walk free. It's farcical and grotesque and tragic all at once; Ramius can barely lift her own weapon, owes them her life, and is acting like a classic military antagonist, the officer too stupid to realise that this situation is beyond the rules.

What's most interesting on a second watch is how closely the students' position - that the Earth military shouldn't be here, they're neutral in a conflict that has nothing to do with them - mirrors that which our protagonists, Ramius included, will eventually adopt. *Gundam* is never shy about its politics, but I'm pleased by the balance it's showing here, introducing its themes and philosophies in a way that already paints them as ambiguous. Ramius shouts at the kids, calling them na√Øve, but that anger is at least partly because their arguments have struck home; she knows, just as we viewers do, that the Earth military is in the wrong. The series doesn't beat us over the heads with the historical parallels, or (as far as I know) retell a specific incident too closely, but it doesn't have to; for a British viewer, the comparisons to e.g. the *Lusitania* or the *Hydro* are obvious enough, because the same points are applicable to so many wars.
