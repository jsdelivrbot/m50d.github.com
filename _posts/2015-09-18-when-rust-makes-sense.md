Even as I've admired the design work going into Rust, I've been confused by its growing popularity. A language without garbage collection, in 2015? There are use cases where you need that, and a replacement for C++ in its remaining niches is a worthy goal, but for most developers managing one's own memory is an extravagance, akin to growing one's own food - something you might do on a hobby project, but never for a paying client.

It seemed bizzare that users of Python or Ruby looking for an ordinary, general-purpose language with a decent type system would fall on this systems language. Rust's spectacular engineering makes memory management far less of a chore than it's predecessors - but a chore it remains. The language puts an emphasis on memory usage that- well, saving memory is never unwelcome, but for general-purpose languages there are generally better places to spend your budget.

But then I tried to put myself in their position, and survey the landscape of mainstream functional languages - or rather, mainstream languages with decent type systems - with fresh eyes.

## Haskell

The 800lb gorilla - and for the most part it deserves its reputation. But at the same time it's hard to recommend 

## Scala

My own weapon of choice.

## F#

I've played with F# but I don't know
