title: Automated Releasing with Maven
---

One of the proofs that the software industry is still immature is how much effort is still duplicated. I've now worked the same job in three very different industries, and while there has been plenty of business-specific stuff, there are some things I've found myself writing again each time: a type-safe [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) query language, a responsive AJAX layer for [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org), and a release system for [Maven](http://maven.apache.org).

Maven is one of the most hated pieces of software around, in my view entirely unjustly.

My first employer, MX Telecom (now [OpenMarket](http://www.openmarket.com)) was a great place to work in many ways, but not a huge contributor to open source (at least compared to last.fm).
