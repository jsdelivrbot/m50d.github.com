title: Productive Uses of Anger

##Problem
 * It's easier for the privileged to start startups
 * It's easier for the glib to start startups
 * The privileged don't realise they are
 * The glib don't realise they are
 * Taking a lot of other people's money is considered success
 * Startups really are a lot more succesful than any other form of company
 
##Possible Solutions
 * Make it easier for the unprivileged to start startups
  * Make starting a startup safer
  * Do it outside the Valley
 * Make it easier for the inarticulate to start startups
  * Or make it easier for them to learn to pitch - don't like this approach though
 * Make the difference between startup language and normal language more obvious
 * Publicise the poor returns of venture capital
  * Already well-known, yet people keep chucking their money there
  * Perhaps the coming crunch will see a drop in angels. Perhaps.
 * Profit from the coming series-A crunch
 * Make it easier for non-startups to be productive
  * Dovetails with making a startup safer
