Many things are easy to take for granted; air, perhaps, most of all. To a normal person in a normal environment, it's hard to convey how important it is. And yet *Gravity* manages it so well that I walked out quite literally gasping.

The other thing missing is people. This is an intensely solitary film; Stone (Bullock) and Kolawski (Clooney) are cut off first from everyone else, and then from each other. While the film has to use a few tricks to let them reveal their thoughts through conversation, some of the most intense moments come from Ryan talking to an inanimate piece of equipment, or not talking at all. The film's actually quite soft on the silence and beauty of space - despite the opening text, there's plenty of orchestral background music, and the Earth mostly stays in the background (indeed, for its most beautiful sunrise *Gravity* ignores the rules and tells us without showing). This is probably the most detailed, realistic space movie to date (for all the issues of seeing high-velocity debris before it hits you), but the actual space part feels paradoxically understated.

I read *Moondust: In Search of the Men who Fell to Earth* recently, which I also highly recommend. What struck me most as I read was the sheer *audacity* of the Apollo programme; you self-important apes think you can go *how many* kilometers? And you're gonna do this in what's basically a *ball of tin foil*? And yet it worked - and even in the case where it didn't, *Apollo 13* - our finest hour, as the movie puts it - we were able to keep everyone alive. I'm tearing up just writing this.
