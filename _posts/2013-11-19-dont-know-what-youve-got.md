Many things are easy to take for granted; air, perhaps, most of all. To a normal person in a normal environment, it's hard to convey how important it is. And yet *Gravity* manages it so well that I walked out quite literally gasping.

I read *Moondust: In Search of the Men who Fell to Earth* recently, which I also highly recommend. What struck me most as I read was the sheer *audacity* of the Apollo programme; you self-important apes think you can go *how many* kilometers? And you're gonna do this in what's basically a *ball of tin foil*? And yet it worked - and even in the case where it didn't, *Apollo 13* - our finest hour, as the movie puts it - we were able to keep everyone alive. I'm tearing up just writing this.
